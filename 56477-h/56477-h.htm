<h4><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h4>


<p>In the present edition of the "Lady's Country
Companion," a reduction has been made in the
price, to render the work still more generally
useful than it has hitherto been; but in all other
respects it is essentially the same.</p>

<p>The principal object of this work is to save
young housekeepers the pain and trouble of
buying their own experience; and though it is
particularly addressed to those residing in the
country, I have had the satisfaction of finding
that it has been in many cases almost equally
useful to those living in towns. It may, however,
be interesting to my readers to know that
it was originally written for the benefit of a
young friend, who was precisely in the position I
have represented Annie to be in, and who, knowing
I had resided in the country in my youth,
asked my advice. Of course, in preparing the
work for publication, many things were added or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
enlarged on, particularly in the parts relating to
cooking and gardening, and in the suggestions
for altering and furnishing the house; but nearly
all the housekeeping and farm-yard details were
the result of my personal experience. It happened
in my youth, that my father, who was in
the law, was obliged, from ill health, to give up
his profession, and to reside in the country; and
as my mother was dead I kept his house. I had
thus to practise what I have here attempted to
teach; and I shall be only too happy if I am the
means of sparing others the annoyances I suffered
myself.</p>

<p>I have stated these facts now, as it is possible,
from the gradually declining state of my health,
I may not have another opportunity of mentioning
them in their proper place, and as I
think my readers will be likely to place more
confidence in my counsels when they know they
are founded on realities. I have always been
anxious to make my books useful, but I am now
still more so than ever I was before.</p>

<h4>INTRODUCTION.</h4>


<p>Your letter, my dear Annie, informing me that
you are about to be married and to settle in the
country, has interested me exceedingly, as it reminds
me of my own youth, when my first essays in
housekeeping were made under circumstances very
similar to those in which you will be placed. It is
true I was not then married, but, as my mother
was dead, the care of the house devolved on me;
and I knew even less about household affairs than
most girls of my age and rank in life, as my
mother had an old and favourite housekeeper,
who managed every thing, and who would not
suffer the slightest interference in her department.
When my mother died, this person left
us; and my father, with a shattered constitution
and a greatly diminished fortune, retired to a
small estate he had in the country. I was then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
young and thoughtless; I had no sisters; and
having, like you, been brought up in a town, I
had no ideas of the country but as a place where
eggs, cream, and fruit were in abundance; where
I might keep as much poultry as I liked; and
where there were shady lanes, and green fields
abounding with pretty flowers.</p>

<p>The place we went to live at had a good
house, commanding a splendid view; an excellent
garden; three fish-ponds, and about thirty
acres of grass land, which enabled us to keep
cows and horses, without troubling us with any
of the laborious duties of cultivating arable land.</p>

<p>At first I was enchanted with the change.
I was never tired of feeding my poultry,
watching the dairy-maid, and managing the
fruit and flowers; but, alas! I soon found that
there are few roses without thorns. My first
trouble was three gentlemen calling on us one
day unexpectedly, and my father asking them to
stay dinner. We were seven miles from the town
where we had formerly lived; and, though there
was a small town within two miles of us, the road
was bad, and the miles very long ones; while the
town itself, when we reached it, was one of those
provoking places the shopkeepers of which never
have what is wanted, though they always say
they had abundance of the required article the
week before, and believe they shall have it again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the week after. I need not enter into the details
of my troubles in preparing for this well-remembered
dinner. Meat was out of the question;
and though I was enabled, with infinite difficulty,
to give my father's friends enough to eat, no one
but a young housekeeper in a similar situation
can have any idea of what I suffered. The lesson,
however, was not lost upon me; and you may
easily imagine that ever afterwards I took care
to have a cooked piece of hung beef, or ham, or
some similar substantial article of food in the
house, that I might be provided for a similar
occurrence.</p>

<p>The recollection of what I underwent while
buying my experience makes me anxious to spare
you, my dear Annie, the pain of a similar ordeal;
particularly as it is more disagreeable for a
young newly married woman to feel in housekeeping
difficulties than a single one; as it makes
you fear your husband had a higher opinion of
you than you deserve. In your situation the
difficulty is increased by your husband not having
lived at the Manor-House since the death of his
parents, when he was only ten years old; so that
he can have no idea of the petty troubles you
will be exposed to. Under these circumstances I
will do my best to clear the path that lies before
you, and to teach you how to enjoy rationally a
country life.</p>

<h4>LETTER II.</h4>

<h5>FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THE COUNTRY&mdash;MAKING FIRES.</h5>


<p>You complain, my dear Annie, that when I wrote
to congratulate you on your marriage, I did not
send you any of the advice I promised. The
neglect was intentional. I was unwilling to disturb
the happiness of the honeymoon by any
allusion to the troubles of life; but now that you
are actually arrived at the mansion which is to be
your future dwelling, I will not delay any longer
beginning the fulfilment of my task. I am sorry
to hear that you felt chilled and depressed at the
first appearance of the Manor-House; though I
am not surprised that you found the room you
were ushered into dark and cold, since you tell me
that the windows are shaded by some lofty Scotch
pines, which are certainly the most gloomy of all
the vegetable race, and which must necessarily
impede both the light and the warmth of the sun.
You add that you are ten miles from a market-town,
and at least seven from any visitable neighbours;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
that the kitchen-garden is a mile from the
house, and under the care of a cross old gardener,
who cannot be displaced; that there is no separate
flower-garden; and, in short, that if it were not
for your affection for your husband, you would be
miserable.</p>

<p>Your letter would make me very uneasy on
your account if I had not had a good deal of experience
of the world; but I am comforted when
I reflect that in early youth the vehemence of our
feelings always makes us exaggerate both our
pains and our pleasures. Have you ever looked
at a landscape through a window of coloured glass,
and remarked the cold and miserable appearance
presented through the purple pane, contrasted
with the rich glow thrown upon every object by
the orange glass? Both give a false idea of the
reality; but the impressions thus received are not
more erroneous than those we often experience of
what passes around us, when viewed through the
medium of our feelings. I thus consider your
letter as produced by a view taken through the
purple glass; and I am far from believing that
you will dislike the country when you know it
better; and still less do I give credence to your
vehement assertion that you never can be happy
in your present residence.</p>

<p>Happiness, I suspect, in most cases, depends
more upon ourselves than we are generally willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
to allow; and I am quite sure that young married
people who are attached to each other, and have
a competency, may be happy if they will, particularly
in the country, where their principal
amusements must all centre in home. You will,
perhaps, be surprised to find that I think this a
cause of happiness, but you will find in time that
I am right; and that our chances of being happy
decrease in proportion as we depend upon others
for our enjoyments. I cannot conceive a more
miserable life than that of a beauty who has no
pleasure but in being admired; and who, consequently,
must pass her time in fits of alternate
depression and excitement. It would give me
the greatest pain to see you plunge into this species
of mental intoxication, and I rejoice that you
are placed in a situation where you will not be
exposed to the temptations arising from bad example.
In this respect your present abode seems
to be everything I could wish; as, from the description
you have given me of the difficulties
attending visiting your neighbours they seem to
be enough to cure the most ardent lover of dissipation;
and, unless the neighbours be more than
commonly agreeable, I think you will not feel
inclined&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;&mdash;"Frequent visits to make</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Through ten miles of mud for formality's sake,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With the coachman in drink, and the moon in a fog,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And no thought in your head but a ditch or a bog."</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Do not suppose from this that I think you
should be unsociable; on the contrary, I think it
a duty to mix occasionally with the world, as,
unless we do so, we should soon learn to set a
false value upon ourselves and upon every thing
around us. The society of persons in our own rank
in life is, therefore, essential to teach us our true
level; and I have no doubt you will find some
agreeable persons among your neighbours when
you know them better, whose friendship you will
think worth cultivating.</p>

<p>I will now take your objections to your residence
in detail; and we will try if some remedy cannot
be devised for them. I am glad your house is
large. In town, we are often content to put up
with the inconveniences occasioned by want of
room, as we know that space is valuable, and cannot
always be had; but, in the country, where we
feel the free air, and see no houses before us, it
seems hard to be confined. You may also find it
convenient, in the winter, to have room to take
exercise within doors; and I hope you have a
good-sized hall or gallery to play at battledore
and shuttlecock in; for that is a game not to
be despised in the list of country amusements.
The trees are certainly an objection. Our ancestors
seem to have had strange ideas about planting
trees in front of a dwelling. It is true, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
modern conveniences of blinds and verandas were
then probably unknown; and, therefore, a few
trees were judged agreeable to shade the windows
from the glaring light and heat of the sun. At
least, this appears to me the only way of accounting
for the strange manner in which we often see
trees placed close to the windows of an ancient
manor-house, as though purposely to intercept the
prospect, and to impede the entrance of two of the
greatest blessings of nature, light and free air.
I should hope that your husband will consent to
have these trees cut down, or at least thinned out;
and I am sure he will find the sacrifice amply
repaid by the air of cheerfulness which will be
given to his rooms. I have also no doubt that
when these rooms are better ventilated, and the
sun is permitted to reach them, you will find them
warmer; though I confess that a country-house is
generally colder than one of the same size in town.
I do not mean from the size of the rooms, for
large rooms, having fewer draughts, are less difficult
to warm than small ones; but because houses
in the country are more exposed to the wind, and
the air round them is colder than in towns. In
some old country-houses the rooms are small, and
there are numerous long, narrow passages, which
are sure to produce draughts: but to cure this
evil, thick curtains may be suspended over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
doors, care being taken not to prevent the doors
from opening freely; or there may be double doors
and double windows.</p>

<p>In warming a room, if an open fireplace be
used, a good deal depends upon the mode of
managing the fire. Servants are very apt to
throw on a quantity of coals at once, in such a
manner as to smother up the flame; and, when
this is the case, the heated air produced by the
imperfect combustion of the coals passes up the
chimney with the smoke, and very little warmth
enters the room. If, on the contrary, the coals
are carefully arranged on the fire so as to allow a
free current of air to pass through them, perfect
combustion takes place, and the coals become a
glowing mass, from which rays of light and heat
spread in every direction; while the cheerful
appearance of a bright glowing fire must be felt
by every one. Where an opportunity occurs of
altering a fireplace, its capability for diffusing
radiant heat will be greatly increased by making
the back and sides of fire-brick or fire-stone; as
these substances retain heat much longer than any
kind of metal, and are consequently more likely
to prevent the fire from being chilled by the
addition of fresh coal. Drying the coal before
burning it is an excellent plan to prevent smoking,
as it makes the fire exceedingly bright and
fierce. It is true that the coal appears to vanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
with extraordinary rapidity, but the combustion
is so complete, that a much greater quantity of
radiant heat is evolved from the same quantity of
fuel.</p>

<p>In many country places it is convenient to
burn wood, especially where the fireplaces are
large, as wood burns best on the hearth, or with
the logs supported by what are called andirons or
dogs; and fires of this kind harmonise admirably
with large rooms and the general appearance of
the fittings up of an old country-house. A wood
fire, however, requires a good deal of attention to
manage it well, as, without care, it will often go
out before the logs are half burnt; especially when
wood is burnt in a grate, unless it is mixed with
a little coal, and there is a plate at the bottom of
the grate to keep in the ashes. It must also be
remembered, that, though large logs are very
useful to make a large fire, yet, when a quick
supply of heat is required, it is best to use wood
cut into short thick pieces; and that wood burns
much better when dry than when green. Green
wood, indeed, contains about one-third of its
weight of water, which of course evaporates in
the shape of vapour, and this vapour aids in
carrying the heat up the chimney; dry wood, on
the contrary, produces a clear bright fire, which
gives out radiant heat. Opinions differ as to
what kind of wood is best for fuel. Pine wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
burns freely, from the quantity of turpentine it
contains, but it does not give out much heat.
Beech is preferred on the continent of Europe,
and maple in America; but Count Rumford says
that the greatest mass of radiant heat is produced
by the fuel of the lime tree. Generally speaking,
close-grained smooth woods make better fuel than
those the grain of which is open and rough.
Pine cones are admirable for lighting a fire; and
you will find the gloomy Scotch pines, which have
so annoyed you with their shade, may be useful in
this respect, as producing an article of domestic
economy.</p>

<p>If any of your chimneys should smoke, the usual
remedy is contracting the mouth of the chimney,
or raising it higher by the addition of a chimney-pot.
The last is a most unsightly remedy, and I
hope you will not have occasion to try it. Indeed,
old houses seldom smoke, unless their chimneys
are damp for want of use, or that birds have
built in them; though nothing can be more
common than to have smoky chimneys in modern
houses. One reason, I believe, is, that newly
built chimneys very often smoke because they
have not been properly cored; that is, the projecting
pieces of mortar, &amp;c., which are formed
inside the chimney while it is building, have not
been removed, and prevent the proper ascent of
the smoke. Another common fault in modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
fireplaces is, that they are too shallow to allow
sufficient space for the grate; and, when the
grate is set too far forward into the room, it
is evident that a very strong draught will be
required to draw the smoke up the chimney.
Neither of these faults is common in old houses;
in them the chimneys are generally as smooth
inside as the walls of the room, and the fireplaces
are usually two feet deep, or even more, instead
of being only nine inches, as I am told is the case
with some modern villas. I say nothing about
stoves, as I confess myself prejudiced against them,
from the numerous fires they have occasioned;
and I think open fireplaces not only safer and
more agreeable, but much more conducive to
health, as they aid in ventilating the apartments,
and without a constant change of air there can be
neither health nor happiness.</p>

<p>In speaking of the different kinds of fuel, I
forgot to mention peat and charcoal, but you will
find these more useful in the kitchen than in the
parlour; and coke I would not advise you to employ,
on account of its close unpleasant smell.</p>

<h5>HALL.&mdash;MORNING ROOM.&mdash;BOOK-CASES; PLANTS IN POTS;
SQUIRRELS; CANARY BIRDS, PARROTS AND MACAWS;
MONKEYS; GOLD FISH; AND CUT
FLOWERS.&mdash;DRAWING-ROOM.&mdash;DINING-ROOM.</h5>


<p>I have just received your letter, enclosing a
plan of your house and a sketch of its present appearance;
and, I confess, it appears to me that
you have not complained of its gloominess without
having abundant reason for doing so. Pray
tell your husband, however, that I fully sympathise
with his reluctance to cut down trees that he has
been familiar with from his boyhood; and that, so
far from liking to see wood felled myself, I feel
positive pain when even the large limb of a noble
tree falls to the ground. But I think it a weakness
to give way too much to this feeling; and, if
I had a favourite tree that I was convinced was
injurious to the health, or even to the comfort, of
human beings, I would instantly have it cut down,
in the same manner as I would submit, without
hesitation, to the amputation of an arm or a leg, if
I had sustained an injury that I was quite sure
could not be cured in any other way. You say
you felt excessively pained when your husband
said, that, though he did not think any circumstances
could ever have induced him to order those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
trees to be cut down, he was quite delighted to
have such an opportunity of pleasing you; and
that, when you heard the workmen employed in
cutting the trees down the following morning,
you felt every blow they struck, and you thought
he must hate you for wishing him to make such a
sacrifice. These feelings are quite natural; but,
in my opinion, the readiness with which your husband
complied with your wishes will strengthen
the bond of affection between you instead of
weakening it, as there cannot possibly be a
stronger proof of love than is shown in sacrificing
our prejudices in favour of the beloved object;
and I am sure, with your grateful and amiable
disposition, you will be delighted to prove that
you can make sacrifices in your turn, whenever a
proper opportunity for doing so may occur.</p>

<p>I am sure the removal of these trees will make
the house appear more cheerful; and I can now only
recommend you strongly to take care that your
rooms are well ventilated, by the windows being
always opened in fine weather, whenever the
rooms are unoccupied, for, I repeat, though you
laughed at my former assertion, that a free circulation
of air is essential both to health and
happiness. You ask, how is it possible that fresh
air can contribute towards happiness? and I, in
return, ask you if you have never felt the influence
of a fine clear bracing morning in making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
you feel gay and happy, quite independently of
moral causes. On such occasions,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"The bosom's lord sits lightly on his throne,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>and we feel equal to any exertion that may be
required of us. Look at the contrast between
country children, as they run shouting and laughing
only from the irrepressible glee of their own
hearts, and the children of a close and over-populated
town, who creep from school shivering and
sad, with countenances as dull as the appearance
of the atmosphere they are compelled to breathe.
You enjoy in the country the inestimable advantage
of being able to procure as much fresh air
as you like, only by opening your windows; but
the inhabitants of towns, when they throw open
their sashes, often admit air more impure than
that already in their rooms.</p>

<p>I will now give you my opinion as to the best
method of furnishing your rooms, so as to make
them look as cheerful as possible.</p>

</div>

<p>I see by the plan (fig. 1.) that you have a good-sized
<i>hall</i>, so that you will have room for playing
at battledore and shuttlecock after all; and I
repeat that it is a game not to be despised, though
you do speak so contemptuously of the</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Transports that shuttlecock yields."</span><br />
</p>

<p>I think you do wrong to treat with so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
scorn these trifling amusements. It is the part
of true wisdom to enjoy every harmless pleasure
which falls within our reach, provided we do not
occupy, by so doing, those hours which ought to
be devoted to more serious employments. Thus,
if you do not like battledore and shuttlecock,
perhaps you may billiards, and your hall would
do admirably for a billiard-table. The small room
on the right hand is your husband's business-room,
and it is very conveniently situated, as people who
want to see him on justice-business, or to show
him dogs, or any thing relating to sporting, &amp;c.,
can go in by the side glass door, without entering
the house.</p>

<p>On the other side of the hall is the room you
thought so gloomy the night you first arrived;
and this I would advise you to fit up partly as
a <i>library</i>, and partly as a <i>morning sitting-room</i>.
I see that one of the windows faces the east; and
this you will find is in itself sufficient to make
the room pleasant for a morning room, as you
will have the rising sun upon it, and that always
diffuses an agreeable warmth in a room, at a
period of the day when warmth is particularly
agreeable. I wish the other window looked on
a flower-garden, as it faces the south; and, now
that the gloomy Scotch pines have been cut
down, it would be just a little sheltered place,
where flowers would delight to grow, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
if your husband would consent to remove a small
cedar that I see still casts a shade upon it. However,
we must not ask for too much at once; and,
till your flower-garden is made, I would advise
you to have a few plants in pots in the east window.
Remember though, you must have only
a few plants, as more than five or six would give
the window the appearance of being a substitute
for a greenhouse, a most unpleasant idea at any
time, and particularly so in the country. Two
rather tall and spreading geraniums, with showy
trusses of flowers, a large well-trained Sóllya
heterophýlla, a fine Polýgala oppositifòlia, and
two showy well-grown Fuchsias, will be quite
enough. They should be in large handsome
pots, standing in saucers for the sake of cleanliness;
and care should be taken not to fill the
pots with earth higher than to within about an
inch from the brim, so as to leave plenty of room
for watering. The space left should be filled with
water every morning, and the water suffered to
run through the pots into the saucers; which, after
waiting about ten minutes, or more if necessary,
so to allow as much water as possible to drain
through the earth in the pots, should be emptied,
as nothing can be more injurious to most kinds of
plants in pots than to let water stand in their
saucers. If a constant fire be kept in the room so
that the air is always hot and dry, the pots in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
which the plants are kept should be set within
other pots, and the space between the two filled
with moss. This is also a good plan with plants
in balconies, to prevent the roots of the plants
becoming dry and withered. Plants in rooms
always require a great deal more water than plants
in a greenhouse, to counteract the dry atmosphere
of a living-room; and when practicable they should
be set out in the rain, or syringed over head, to
wash off the dust which, from sweeping the room
and other causes, will inevitably rest on the leaves
and choke up their pores, thus impeding the action
of these very important organs. Air also is as
essential to the health of plants as it is to that of
human beings, as both live by decomposing it; and
thus when plants are kept in a room, that room
requires to be more carefully ventilated than
would otherwise be necessary.</p>

<p>You say that all your rooms must be completely
new furnished, and ask my advice as to
the colours of the curtains, &amp;c., in the different
rooms. It is extremely difficult to give this, as
taste differs exceedingly as to colours. As general
rules, however, it may be observed that cold
colours, such as pale blues and greens, never look
well in rooms lighted from the north; and that
warm colours, such as rich yellows and reds, should
be avoided in rooms lighted from the south. As,
however, it is desirable, if possible, to shake off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the dislike you have taken to what I hope you
will make your morning sitting-room, and as that
dislike has arisen partly from the gloomy dark
green curtains and dingy tapestry on the walls,
I would advise you to adopt only light colours
in the furniture; particularly as the room will
be generally used by daylight. First, the tapestry
must be entirely removed: indeed you say
it is already half-decayed from age and damp;
and I would then advise you to have the walls, if
they are in a proper state, painted or papered
according to your fancy; taking care that the
colour of the curtains and other furniture harmonizes
with that of the walls. If your curtains
are of moreen or damask you should have inner
curtains of white muslin, which may be trimmed
with lace, or have a coloured border: and these
white curtains alone you will probably find sufficient
during summer. There should be two sofas,
an easy chair or two, comfortable footstools, and
several small tables of different kinds, in addition
to the ordinary chairs and tables; and I
should add a chiffonier and a cabinet piano. You
can, if you wish to be economical, have brown
holland covers to the sofa and chairs; and you
can pin plain white muslin over the silk of the
piano and the chiffonier, to save them from the
flies. The carpet may be Brussels, or Kidderminster,
or a printed drugget, the first of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
three being far the most expensive; the Kidderminster
carpet and the drugget are nearly alike in
price, but the drugget looks best, though it does
not wear well. Whatever the material of the
carpet may be, the colours should correspond
with those of the furniture and the walls. As
your books will be in daily use, they will be best
in open cases with a little curtain of leather nailed
along the shelves to keep out the dust. They
should always, if possible, fill up entirely the
space left for them; and on this account it is best
to have movable shelves where it is practicable.
Should the books not stand high enough to fill
the space for them, the housemaid may remove
the dust with a goose's wing, or with one of those
brushes with long hairs now sold for similar purposes;
but do not let her take the books down
oftener than twice a year, as frequent removals
will not only injure the binding of your books,
but will occasion you great annoyance, from the
confused manner in which they are sure to be
replaced on the shelves.</p>

<p>I know you were always fond of pets, though you
never kept any, as your aunt did not like them;
but now you are your own mistress, I think it
very likely you will have a canary bird, and perhaps
a parrot; and I am sure you will have some
gold fish, which you will keep in your morning
room. I would not advise you to keep a squirrel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
on account of its unpleasant smell in a cage, and
its hiding propensities out of one; though in
other respects squirrels are pretty little creatures
from their gracefulness and agility, and the intelligence
that sparkles in their bright little eyes.
If you do keep a squirrel, feed it with bread
scalded in hot water, and plenty of nuts; and
take care that its cage is cleaned, its hay changed,
and its tin for food washed out with hot water,
every day.</p>

<p>Your canary bird, if you have one, should be
kept scrupulously clean, and the bottom of its
cage should be strewed with clean sand every morning.
It should also have fresh water every day,
both for drinking and bathing, the latter being in
a shallow vessel; in the moulting season a small
bit of iron may be put in the water for drinking,
but no other medicine should be given. Its food
should be as simple as possible, and should consist
principally of summer rape seed, that is, those
small brown rape seeds which are produced by
plants sown in spring, and are ripe in summer;
and not those sown in autumn and reaped in spring,
which are large and black. A little duck-weed in
spring, lettuce leaves in summer, endive in autumn,
and slices of sweet apple in winter, may be
added; and occasionally a few poppy or canary
seeds, and a very small quantity of bruised hemp
seed: but this last should be given as a great treat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
and only sparingly: all sugar, bread, and other
delicacies, are very injurious. It must never be
forgotten that birds kept in cages are in a most
unnatural state, and that they require the greatest
care to keep them in health. Three things should
be especially attended to: viz. cleanliness, simple
food, and abundance of fresh air. This last particular
may appear strange to those who know
that the canary bird, being a native of a warm
climate, is easily injured by cold; so much so indeed,
that in winter its cage should never be hung
in a room without a fire. But, notwithstanding
this, it should have the windows of the room open
frequently when the sun shines, even in winter;
and in summer it should be kept as much as possible
in the open air. The poor little creature
shows its own feeling on the subject indeed very
distinctly; for, as soon as it is placed near an
open window in the sunshine, it begins to bathe,
and to preen its feathers, and then it sings gaily
its loudest songs of joy, frequently fluttering its
wings at the same time, as though from a sensation
of intense enjoyment. The cage for a single
canary bird should never be less than eight inches
in diameter and a foot high, and should have
sticks placed across it at different heights for the
bird to perch on.</p>

<p>Parrots, macaws, and cockatoos thrive best on a
pole with a stand at the bottom for sand, as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
tail and wing feathers generally become ragged
when they are kept in a cage. Some grey parrots
and blue macaws are very apt to pull out their
breast feathers; but this is the result of a disease
brought on by eating too much meat. The same
cause also brings on gout in the feet, and other
complaints. All the parrot tribe are hard-beaked
birds, and consequently not carnivorous: their
food in their native country is grain and fruit, and
their habits in this respect should always be kept
in view in feeding them; for though birds in confinement
are in an unnatural state, and require
more indulgences than they would need if wild in
the woods, yet they should never have food given
to them which their organs are quite unfitted to
digest. Parrots and other similar birds should
therefore be fed as much as possible on ripe fruit,
boiled wheat or Indian corn, and milk; or, if these
articles be not attainable, bread or captain's biscuit
soaked in boiling water, with enough milk added
to enable the bird to drink, will be found the best
substitute. Bird-fanciers use generally bread
made without salt, and very well baked, crumbled
into water and then slightly squeezed; but the
birds get very thin if kept for a long time only
on this diet, and require a little milk, though that
is a food they certainly never can have in their
natural state. Bechstein says that they will get
fat on the seed of the safflower (<i>Cárthamus tinctòrius</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and indeed these seeds are called by the
French <i>graines de perroquets</i>. Though the parrot
tribe are not carnivorous, they are all very
fond of a bone to pick; and I believe that
they may be indulged with one occasionally, provided
there is no fat and very little meat on it.
Parrots should be supplied every day with clean
water to wash, and their feet should be frequently
examined and cleaned from any dirt that may be
adhering to them.</p>

<p>Should you take a fancy to a pet monkey, most
of the common kinds are kept chained to a pole
on a stand, and fed like parrots; but marmozets,
which are pretty little creatures, are very tender,
and are generally kept in a cage like squirrels.
They will eat animal food, and one that was at
liberty is said to have snatched a gold fish out of
the water, and devoured it. The most interesting
circumstance relating to them is, however, their
fondness for their young, which is nursed by both
the male and female like a baby.</p>

<p>Gold and silver fish are very ornamental and
suitable objects to keep in a lady's morning room.
It is generally supposed that they are quite incapable
of affection; but some that we have certainly
knew me again when I came back after
having been out of town; and one, which I call
Goldy, and which we have had four or five years,
will come and nibble my finger when I put it near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
him, or swim after a feather when I draw it gently
along the surface of the water.</p>

<p>It is, however, very difficult to keep gold fish
long in a room, particularly in a glass globe.
When it is wished to do so, only two or three
should be in one globe, and the water should be
changed every day in winter, and twice a day in
summer; the fish having no food but the animalcula
which they find in the water, which should
always be from a pond or river, as spring water is
not only too cold, but often contains some mineral
substance which is likely to prove injurious.
When several fish are kept in a small space, the
water should either be kept continually changing
by a fountain, or in some other mode; or the fish
should be fed with some farinaceous substance,
but never with baker's bread, as it is decidedly
injurious to them. I am told that the dealers in
gold fish, who always keep a great number together
in darkness, in a large tub or tank, feed
them twice a day with boiled grits; other persons
recommend crushed barley or oats: in France
they use a kind of paste made of maize or Indian
corn; and in America, I am told, they prefer
brewer's grains, or a paste made of bran and flour.
Whenever farinaceous food of any kind is used, it
should be given in small quantities, and be quite
fresh; the vessel in which the fish are kept being
always cleaned thoroughly every day, to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the possibility of any of the food in a sour state
remaining in it.</p>

<p>Though gold and silver fish certainly look best
in a glass globe, I doubt whether they live so
long in one as they will do in an opaque vessel.
When I kept my fish in a large oblong china vase,
I lost only one in five years; but in a glass globe
I lost seven in about six months. I tried various
modes of treatment, such as putting gravel in the
water, and giving the fish duck-weed and pond-weed
to shelter them from the sun; but I had still
the mortification to see my fish die, and generally
without any apparent cause. The first symptom
was the fish appearing languid and unwilling to
move; but in a few hours, it began to swim on
one side, and when turned on the other side it
instantly resumed its former position; shortly
after, the tail drooped down, so as to throw the
body into an angular position, and in the course
of a few hours the poor fish was dead. It is true
that the year in which these experiments were
tried appears to have been decidedly unfavourable
for gold fish, as a great many died, even in ponds,
where they are generally much more healthy than
when kept in rooms. In one instance, especially,
nearly twenty died in the marble basin of a fountain,
where fish had been kept for years with an
average of not more than two or three deaths in a
year. In many cases, the cause of death in gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
fish is evidently a plant nearly allied to the green
scum formed on stagnant water. This plant,
which is called Achyla prolífera, consists principally
of threads so exceedingly fine as to be imperceptible
to the naked eye, but which take root
in the body of the fish, as the mistletoe grows on
the apple tree, and in time produce a soft downy
substance like mould, that first appears on the
gills and tail, but gradually covers the whole body
of the fish. When this extraordinary disease, if
it may be so called, is discovered in its first stages,
it may be stopped by sprinkling salt on the back
and sides of the fish; but the application appears
to cause intense pain, as the fish, as soon as it feels
the salt, darts from one side to the other of the
vessel that contains it, and appears to be writhing
with agony. This, however, soon goes off, and
the fish appears quite restored, seldom requiring
a second application.</p>

<p>The best way of keeping gold and silver fish is
certainly in a pond in the garden; particularly if the
situation be warm and exposed to the sun. It is
necessary, however, if the pond be shallow, and
the water clear, to have two or three bundles of
faggots thrown into it, that the fish may find
shade, when they wish it. Faggots are also very
useful when it is wished to breed gold fish; as
they afford both warmth and shelter, without
which gold fish never produce young. When first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
hatched the gold fish is nearly black, but it gradually
becomes streaked with gold or silver; the
metallic hue increasing every year, till the black
finally disappears.</p>

<p>As you are fond of having flowers in your
room, and as your present garden is so far from
your house, you will perhaps be glad to know
how to preserve cut flowers as long as possible.
The most simple rules are, not to put too many
flowers in a glass, to change the water every
morning, and to remove every decayed leaf as
soon as it appears, cutting off the end of the
stems occasionally, as soon as they show any symptoms
of decay. A more efficacious way, however,
is to put nitrate of soda or nitrate of potash (saltpetre)
in powder into the water; as about as
much as can be easily taken up between the forefinger
and the thumb, put into the glass every
time the water is changed, will preserve cut
flowers in all their beauty for above a fortnight.
Camphor in powder has nearly the same effect.</p>

<p>The <i>drawingroom</i> should be fitted up with
more elegance than any other room in the house.
The walls may be panelled, and the panels filled
in with fluted silk, with a gilt moulding round
them; or the walls may be covered with flock or
satin paper, with a gilt moulding under the cornice.
In either case the cornice should be rich;
and there should be bosses on the ceiling to indicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the place for the chandeliers, if you have
any. A slight degree of conformity between the
style of the furniture and that of the house is, I
think, advisable; but, as your house appears to
have had additions made to it in different reigns,
almost any style of furniture that suits your
own taste may be adopted without incongruity.
There should be several large looking-glasses, two
or more chandeliers; and against the walls there
should be a few choice cabinet pictures, which
should be characterised by delicacy and beauty rather
than force. A Claude or two, some of Guido's
exquisite female heads, and one of Raphael's Madonnas,
would be very suitable, or modern paintings
of first-rate artists; but I think no picture
should be admitted unless its subject is elegant as
well as pleasing. There should be large mirrors in
panels, or in richly gilt frames, and a very handsome
white marble chimney-piece, as I see there is but
one indicated in the plan, with a very rich-looking
steel grate, made low to show an ornamented
back. I suppose the windows near the fireplace
are false ones, as otherwise there would be a cross
light; the three windows opening on the terrace
are, however, quite sufficient to give light to the
room; and that at the south end I should like
to see opening into a conservatory. I scarcely
know what colour to recommend for the hangings
of the walls. Full-toned colours lessen the size of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
a room, and light colours enlarge it. Crimson is
very becoming to female beauty, and it has besides
the advantage of being in perfect keeping with the
character of a drawingroom in an old mansion.
The curtains should be silk or silk damask, and
made with either a piped valance or very deep
gold fringe; and the inner muslin curtains should
have a rich border, and be trimmed with either
lace, or with silk fringe of the same colour as the
outer curtains. The chairs should correspond,
and should have a great deal of gilding about
them. The carpet should be Wilton, and made
in one piece, of a pattern to fit the room; and this
pattern should consist chiefly of flowers. There
should be several sofas and ottomans and ornamental
footstools, an excellent piano, and a harp,
ornamental screens to correspond with the style of
the curtains; consoles with richly gilt frames, and
looking-glass slabs and brackets for ornamental
china; candelabra for lights; an elegant ormolu
clock; and in short, a variety of articles that will
suggest themselves; only take care not to crowd
the room too much, lest you should give it the air
of an upholsterer's warehouse rather than a drawingroom.</p>

<p>The <i>dining-room</i> should be characterised by the
massive appearance of its furniture, and the richness
of its hangings. The curtains may be of
maroon-coloured cloth, or moreen, trimmed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
gold. The carpet should be Turkey or Axminster,
and need not quite cover the room, but may
leave a part to be rubbed bright or painted. You
should have a large handsome chimney-piece, and
a large grate, so contrived with a plate at the
bottom, as to contain wood as well as coal. Some
persons advise having no light in a dining-room
except from one large chandelier hung just over the
dinner-table, but sufficiently high above it to cast
no shade; while others recommend side lights to
show the pictures, if there should be any, on the
walls. If there are, they may be of quite a different
character from those in the drawingroom,
and of more solemn and serious subjects, though
still not painful ones; and they may include pictures
by the Dutch masters, and those by English
artists in the domestic style. Your dining-room
is very conveniently placed in being so near the
kitchen; and it is also convenient to have folding-doors
opening into both the dining-room and the
drawingroom, placed exactly opposite each other.
The passage or vestibule between them is useful
in keeping out sounds from the drawingroom, and
also the smell of dinner; and it may easily be made
ornamental by filling the end next the window
with greenhouse plants in flower. These will also
have a good effect from the hall; and in addition
to them, the vestibule may contain a bust or some
choice piece of sculpture, before which may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
placed a lamp. The sideboard in the dining-room
may be placed in the recess left for it.</p>

<p>I have now given you all the advice that I
think you will find requisite; for, after all, you
must remember that, notwithstanding any thing
I may have said, the furniture and decorations of
the rooms must depend principally on your own
taste; I can do no more than point out what kind
of style is suitable to the different rooms, and you
must do the rest.</p>

CIDER, AND PERRY; AND MAKING BREAD, ROLLS, CAKES,
RUSKS, MUFFINS AND CRUMPETS, AND BISCUITS.</h5>


<p>It gave me the greatest pleasure, my dear Annie,
to hear that your husband is so well pleased with
the improvement produced by the removal of the
Scotch pines, that he wishes you to follow my
advice in other things, and that you have actually
ordered furniture for your morning room in accordance
with my suggestions. You ask, however,
why I have said nothing of your husband's
business-room, and add that you suppose I forgot
it; but this was far from being the case. The
reason I omitted it was, that I wished, if he asked
your opinion respecting it, you might be able to
speak entirely from your own feelings, and not
from the advice of another. No female friend
should ever, on any account, interfere between a
man and his wife. In any matter that falls within
your own province, I shall always be delighted to
give you the best advice I can, but that is all.
Should any quarrels arise between you and your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
husband, (and it would be very strange, indeed, if
there should not,) your best plan is to keep them
entirely to yourself, and never to ask advice respecting
them from any friend whatever.</p>

<p>But to return to your house. I was very much
surprised to find that you were annoyed with flies,
till I read "notwithstanding all the pains our
careful housemaid takes to catch them with saucers
of sugar and water." This explained the mystery.
It is the saucers of sugar and water that attract
the flies, and, indeed, one half of what are called
remedies for these little pests only increase the
nuisance. Besides, without pretending to any
morbid sensibility, I must confess that I always
think the sight of the poor flies struggling to get
out of the liquid grave into which they have
been entrapped extremely painful to the feelings.
I know it is a law of nature that all creatures should
prey upon each other; but I do not like killing
creatures by wholesale, when there appears no
absolute necessity for so doing. I think if you
remove your sugar and water, your flies will disappear
of themselves; and, if they do not, you
must, in such rooms as are lighted from one side
only, adopt our kind friend Mr. Spence's admirable
plan of putting network over the window-frame,
so that whenever the window is opened, either at
the top or the bottom, the space is still covered
with the net. You will be astonished to see how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
efficacious this simple plan is; as, though the flies
could easily get through the meshes, they are
afraid of trying, lest they should be entrapped.</p>

<p>I will now proceed to say a few words on your
servants' offices, and of these the <i>housekeeper's room</i>
generally ranks first. As I see no store-closet
marked in your plan, I suppose you will make the
housekeeper's room serve for that purpose; particularly
as you say you mean to be your own housekeeper;
and you will find the store-closet a most important
place in the country, as it is necessary to
lay in larger stores of all the common articles of
daily consumption than are ever required in a town,
where shops can be sent to on any emergency.
Your housekeeper's room should therefore have
ranges of cupboards and drawers all round it,
to contain the household linen, china, glass,
pickles, preserves, cakes, tea, coffee, sugar, and
in short every article wanted by the family, a
store of which is kept. There should be a bureau,
or desk with drawers beneath, to keep the account-books,
receipts for bills, and other papers relating
to housekeeping; and on one side of the fireplace
you may have a cupboard with iron doors enclosing
a small oven, and a range of charcoal
stoves, for making any dishes in French cookery,
or any cakes or preserves that you may take a
fancy to do yourself, with the assistance of your
maid, apart from the observation of the other servants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
On the other side of the fireplace may be
a similar cupboard, containing a small sink with
a wash-hand basin furnished with a plug and waste-pipe
to let off the water, and two pipes, one to
supply cold water from a cistern, and the other
hot water from a boiler behind the fireplace.</p>

<p>Before fixing up the cupboards the walls should
be made perfectly dry, and, if they are not so,
they should be battened, that is, covered with
canvass strained over slips of wood nailed to the
walls, strong brown paper being afterwards pasted
over the canvass. This preserves a stratum of air
between the walls and the backs of the cupboards,
which effectually excludes damp. You may easily
know when a room is damp by its appearance,
before you have kept any thing in it. If the
walls have been whitewashed, they will show
various-coloured stains; and, if they have been
papered, the paper will hang loose. No expense
should be spared to make a room dry, that is to
be used for keeping stores in, as the mischief done
by damp is incalculable. Lump sugar crumbles
into powder; moist sugar hardens into lumps;
saltpetre and bay salt turn to water; preserves
become mouldy or candied, cakes soft, and linen
mildewed. Nor is the mischief done by damp
confined to any one part of the house. In the
butler's pantry the silver will become spotted; in
the cellar the wine will lose its strength and flavour;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and, in the living-rooms, the oil paintings
will become blistered, and the books and engravings
stained.</p>

<p>But to return to the housekeeper's room. In
one part you can have a cupboard to open with
folding-doors like a wardrobe, for keeping tea
and sugar and similar articles. There should
be shelves in this, on which should stand numerous
tin canisters marked with the names of the different
articles they contain. In the upper part
should be a shelf suspended by cords passing
through holes bored in the corners, for loaves of
sugar, or any similar articles likely to be attacked
by mice. The common tea should be kept in a
chest lined with lead, which may stand in the
lower part of the closet, and the finer kinds should
be kept in canisters. A bag of raw coffee may
also stand on the lower shelf of the closet; but,
after the coffee is ground, it should be kept in a
canister, and as far apart from the tea as possible,
as, if it is near it, it will give the tea an unpleasant
taste. Moist sugar should be kept in a large tin
canister, the lid of which opens with a hinge.
The coffee-mill, if in this apartment, must be
fixed to some part of the room where it will be
quite firm, and yet be so placed that the person
grinding may have room to use the arm freely;
but many persons have the coffee-mill in the kitchen,
and also a mill for pepper. When any thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
is to be ground in a mill, of a different nature from
what it is generally used for, the mill should be first
cleaned by grinding in it a hard crust of bread.</p>

<p>A second cupboard should be set aside for
the soap and candles. In this there should be
some strong hooked nails driven into the wall, for
the kitchen candles; and a kind of bench or
wooden stand for the boxes containing mould
candles, if you use any, though most persons now
prefer the composition or stearine candles with
plaited wicks, as they do not require snuffing.
These candles, and those of wax or spermaceti,
may be kept a long time without injury, if they
are covered with paper within the box, to prevent
them from becoming discoloured, which they
will soon be, if much exposed to the air; but
tallow candles of all kinds should never be kept
more than six months, as, when old, they are very
apt to gutter. Soap, also, should never be kept
too long, or be suffered to become too dry. It is
true that, when used too new, it wastes away
very rapidly; yet, if it is kept more than six
months, and particularly if it becomes too dry, it
cracks and shrinks so much, as to render it very
troublesome to use, and nearly double the quantity
is required.</p>

<p>Dried currants and raisins, for cakes and puddings,
should be kept in canisters in another closet;
and almonds and raisins for dessert in boxes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Sage and other herbs I have found keep best in
powder, after they have been dried in an oven.
Every leaf should be pulled off separately into a
kind of tray made of tin, and put into an oven
when about the right heat for baking bread: as
soon as the leaves are dry enough to rub into
powder, they should be crushed with a rolling
pin, and after being sifted, put into wide-mouthed
bottles, which should be carefully corked. Herbs
thus prepared will keep good without losing their
flavour for years; and they have the advantage of
being always ready for use when wanted, without
the smallest particle of dust.</p>

<p>As I think you have told me you are several
miles from a town, it will be necessary to recollect
every thing that may be wanted when you send
there, to avoid the inconvenience of sending frequently.
For this purpose, I think you will find
it useful to have a slate hanging up beside your
desk in the housekeeper's room, on which you can
write down the name of any article that you find
is nearly exhausted when you are giving it out.</p>

<p>Your <i>kitchen</i> appears, by the plan you have
sent me, to be of a very good size, and well
lighted, which is essential to both comfort and
cleanliness, as it is impossible for the cooking to
be performed properly, or the culinary vessels to
be kept clean, without abundance of light. It is
also well placed, as it faces the north, which a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
kitchen should do whenever it is practicable, to
keep it free from too much sun. In old country
houses the ceiling of the kitchen is frequently
furnished with racks for bacon; and there are
hooks driven into the beams for hung beef, tongues,
and hams, but in other places these are kept in
the larder. In either case I would advise you
always to have a plentiful supply of salted meat
in the house, to be ready for emergencies; and I
would always have a ham, a tongue, or a piece of
hung beef, ready cooked; which will not only be
useful for breakfast, and luncheon, but will be
found a most potent auxiliary in the case of unexpected
guests arriving when the larder may be at
a low ebb. In the course of my experience I
have always found that there are few things more
agreeable to a husband than to be able to take a
friend home unexpectedly, and yet to be sure that
he will find a good and even elegant dinner, without
any bustle or ill-temper being caused by his
appearance. In large establishments the sudden
arrival of a stranger is of very little consequence;
but as your husband has an ancient name to keep
up on limited means, and, above all, as you have
undertaken to be your own housekeeper, you must
remember that, in places where the butcher lives
several miles off, and calls for orders only once or
twice a week, it is essential you should make
such provision as to be never taken off your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
guard. To aid in this I will, if you like, at some
future time, give you a few hints on cookery,
particularly on <i>impromptu</i> dishes, which I trust
you will find useful; but I must now return to
the fitting up of the kitchen.</p>

<p>You tell me you shall want a new kitchen-range,
and ask what kind I would recommend. I would
advise you to shun all those that are said to burn
remarkably little fuel, as they are generally very
complicated, and of course extremely liable to go
out of order; a serious inconvenience any where,
but particularly in the country. I should recommend
you to have an open grate from four feet to
eight feet wide, having of course a contrivance to
make the part intended to contain the fire larger
or smaller at pleasure; and the fireplace should be
at least two feet deep, to allow of a boiler behind
the fire, communicating with another on the side
of the grate, care being taken either to have the
boilers fed constantly by a pipe from a cistern,
or to have them filled every night when the fire is
low, as it is very dangerous to pour cold water
into a boiler when it is nearly empty and quite
hot. The sudden change from heat to cold sometimes
indeed makes the iron contract so rapidly as
to burst the boiler. It is useful to have an oven
on one side of the grate, not, indeed, for baking
any thing, for food seldom has its proper flavour
when cooked in such ovens, but to keep plates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and dishes warm. The floor of a kitchen is
generally laid with stone, but it is a great comfort
to the cook to have a part boarded near a table
under one of the windows, for the convenience
of standing upon the boards when in the act of
cooking. The kitchen doors should have their
hinges on the side next the fireplace, to avoid
disturbing the current of air near the fire when
they are opened.</p>

<p>As your kitchen is large, you may perhaps be
able to have a small range of charcoal pans for
French cooking, in addition to the ordinary
kitchen-range, if you have not something of the
kind in the housekeeper's room; and among your
kitchen utensils you should have two or three
that will be useful in French cooking. One of
these should be a braising pan, with a deep concave
rimmed lid, in which fire can be put whenever
you have any dish cooked that requires fire
above and below; another should be two saucepans,
one going within the other, like a gluepot,
forming a <i>bain marie</i>. German saucepans, and
other enamelled articles for the kitchen, are very
convenient in all dishes where milk or cream is
used; but it is a long time before any liquid
boils in them; and when it does boil, it continues
to do so for a minute or more after the saucepan
is taken from the fire, on account of the enamel
retaining the heat. You ought also to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
cupboard in the kitchen, for the cook to keep
her spices and other articles in, fitted up with
shelves and canisters: and there should be another
closet for the flour tub and bread jar, which should
stand on a board raised at least six inches above
the floor, to keep them from the attacks of mice
and black beetles. The egg-basket and the salt-box
may also find a place in this closet, so as to
keep the general appearance of the kitchen neat
and clean. Of course you will have one or two
dressers for plates and dishes, made with drawers
and cupboards below. Every kitchen should also
contain a clock, that the cook may see exactly
how the time goes, and have no excuse for not
being punctual.</p>

<p>The <i>scullery</i> should be as close to the kitchen
as possible. It should be paved with Yorkshire
stone or brickwork, and it should have a cistern
of water closely adjoining it. In every scullery
there should be a stone sink, with a plate-rack at
one end, and under the plate-rack should be a
slanting dripboard with a kind of gutter at the
base, to convey the water that drains from the
plates and dishes to the waste-pipe of the sink;
and it will be found a great convenience to have
a pipe carried to it from the boiler behind the
kitchen fireplace, in order to afford a constant
supply of hot water. The scullery should also
contain two coppers, one small, for boiling hams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
or large pieces of beef, and another of a much
larger size for brewing.</p>

<p>For <i>brewing</i> twelve gallons of <i>table ale</i> at a time,
the copper should hold eighteen gallons, as about
six gallons of water will be absorbed by the malt.
The usual proportion of malt and hops required
for this quantity is, one bushel of malt and three
quarters of a pound of hops. Pale malt is the
best, and it should be plump and crisp, breaking
readily, and full of flour; it should also taste
sweet. The hops should have no bad smell, and
they should be in condition, that is, they should
abound in the yellow powder called by chemists
lupuline, which makes them feel sticky when
rubbed between the fingers. The malt must be
crushed or ground before it is used. River water
is preferred for brewing, and it should be heated
in the copper to about 175°, or rather more.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/fig_02.jpg" width="250" alt="wood engraving" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 2. <i>Spigot and faucet</i>.</div>
</div>

<p>A large deep tub is then provided, called a
mash-tub, in one side of which, at the distance
of an inch or two from the bottom, is fixed a cock,
or what is called a spigot and faucet (fig. 2.),
with the end which projects within the tub covered
with basket-work to prevent the escape of
the grains when the wort is drawn off. About six
gallons of hot water are then poured into the mash-tub,
and some of the malt is shaken in, a little at
a time, and mixed with the water by the help of a
wooden instrument called a mash-stirrer (fig. 3.);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
more water is then added, and then more malt,
till nearly all the water has been
poured in, and only a peck of malt
is left dry. The dry malt is then
strewed over the mass of malt which
has been mixed with the water, and
the mash-tub, having some sticks
laid across it, is covered with an old
blanket, a piece of sacking, or a
coarse cloth, and the malt is left for an hour and a
half or two hours to steep. This is called mashing
the malt; and the goodness of the ale depends
upon the care with which this operation is performed.
The water should never be suffered to
become cooler during the operation than 160°, or
it will not dissolve the starchy matter contained
in the malt; and, if it is hotter than 180°, the
malt will be set, as the maltsters call it, that is, it
will become changed into a glutinous paste, from
which no strength can be extracted. When the
malt has been sufficiently mashed, the wort is
drawn off by the spigot, and it will be found that
the eighteen gallons of water have only yielded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
about thirteen gallons of wort, and sometimes not
so much.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/fig_03.jpg" width="100" alt="wood engraving" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 3. <i>Mash-stirrer</i>.</div>
</div>

<p>A new kind of mashing-tub
(fig. 4.) has been invented, which
has a false bottom pierced with
holes, through which the wort
filters, instead of being drawn
off by the spigot; and, by an
improvement on this, the hot
water is poured through a tube
into the part of the mashing-tub which is below
the false bottom, and suffered to rise up through
the malt. When ale and beer are to be made, the
ale wort is drawn off first, and then more water is
heated to 175° and put to the malt, to make the
beer; but when all the liquor drawn from the
malt is mixed together, it is called in some places
"table ale," and in others "one-way beer."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/fig_04.jpg" width="200" alt="wood engraving" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 4. <i>Mash-tub</i>.</div>
</div>

<p>While the malt is being mashed, the proper
quantity of hops should be steeped in water,
having been first well rubbed and separated;
and when the wort is drawn off they should
be added to it, and the whole put into the copper
to be boiled. During the boiling the mass
should be frequently stirred, to prevent the hops
from either floating at the top or settling to
the bottom, which they would otherwise be very
apt to do. The boiling should continue briskly
till the liquor begins to break, the time for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
varies from half an hour to two hours and a half,
according to the strength of the wort. The
"breaking" is known by large fleecy flakes which
appear to float in the liquor; and, when it appears,
a bowlful of the liquor is taken out and set aside,
when, if the flakes part and subside, leaving the
wort clear, it is considered enough. Some large
shallow vessels called coolers are then provided,
and some sticks being laid across one of them, a
sieve or wicker basket is set upon them, and the
liquor is ladled out of the furnace into the sieve,
to strain it from the hops. The other coolers are
afterwards filled in the same manner, and then the
whole are exposed to a cool current of air, in
order that the liquor may cool as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>When the liquor is about 70°, it is generally
tunned off into a large vat or cask for it to ferment.
About three quarters of a pint of yeast is mixed
with a little of the wort, and as soon as it begins
to work it is added to the rest. Another mode is,
as soon as the wort has cooled to 70°, to convey
it in the coolers to a cellar, where the temperature
is about 55°, and then to mix two gallons of it
with a pint of good thick yeast, and put it into
an upright eighteen-gallon cask, the head of which
has been knocked out, but which is covered with
a piece of flannel, on which the head is laid
loosely. As soon as the fermentation has begun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
about three gallons more of the wort are added,
provided it has not cooled below 65°; but, if it
has, a pailful must be taken out and heated, so
that when mixed with the rest of the three gallons,
the whole shall be about 70°. When this has
been added to the wort fermenting in the cask
and well stirred, the cask should be covered and
left to work for the night. Early the following
morning the working wort should be tried with a
thermometer, and, if it is between 70° and 75°,
five gallons more of the wort should be added,
heated as before to about 68°. The liquor should
then be stirred, and left for six hours, after which
three gallons more wort at 65° are added. It is
then covered and left for four hours more, after
which nearly all the remaining wort is added,
reserving only about two quarts.</p>

<p>This process is very tedious, but it is said to
make the ale exceedingly fine and clear; and, if the
proportions be one bushel and a half of malt to a
pound and three quarters of hops to make twelve
gallons, it is said exactly to resemble the celebrated
Indian ale. If the heat of the working wort be
ever found above 75°, the remaining wort should
be added cool, and the whole should be tunned out
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In the usual mode of brewing, when the fermentation
has gone on till the yeast begins to
look brown, the beer should be tunned; that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the yeast is removed, and the beer is put into the
casks in which it is to remain; and, in general,
the beer is not taken down into the cellar till at
this period. The casks are placed slantingly,
with the bung out; and they are always kept
quite full, being filled up with beer reserved for
that purpose, as the beer they contain works out.
In about a fortnight all the fermentation will be
over, and the casks may be bunged up.</p>

<p>According to the <i>Indian ale</i> process, two quarts
of wort were kept back from that fermented; and
when the beer is to be tunned, which it is into
two six-gallon casks, a quart of this unfermented
wort is put into each cask, with two table-spoonfuls
of flour and one of salt. The frothy yeast is
then taken off the beer, which is poured into the
barrels till it reaches the bunghole, and the froth
begins to flow over: as the froth subsides, the
barrels may be filled up with fresh beer, and the
yeast which flows down should be caught in a
vessel placed for the purpose. In a few days the
yeast will become thick, and will cease to flow
over: the barrels should then be filled up and the
bungholes covered with brown paper, coated with
thick yeast: the fermentation will afterwards
proceed more slowly, and in a fortnight the barrels
may be bunged down, and the bungs covered
with a mass of moistened clay and sand. The
Indian ale should be kept six months before it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
tapped; but the other kind may be drunk in a
month.</p>

<p><i>Home-made wines</i> may be manufactured from
almost any kind of fruit; and they are divided
into two kinds, viz. those made with cold water,
and those made with hot water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/fig_05.jpg" width="150" alt="wood engraving" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 5. <i>Fruit-crusher.</i></div>
</div>

<p><i>Green Gooseberry wine</i> is made in the first manner,
by crushing the fruit in a deep tub with a
fruit-crusher (fig. 5.), and
pouring cold water on it, in the
proportion of one gallon of
water to ten pounds of fruit.
It is then left to stand about
six hours, when the mass, or
marc, as it is called, is put
into a coarse bag and pressed;
more water is afterwards
poured over the marc, which is again pressed, till
as much water has been added as will make the
proportion in all four gallons of water to ten
pounds of fruit. The marc is then thrown away,
and to every gallon of the liquor, or must, as it
is called, three pounds of lump sugar are added,
and the whole is well stirred together; the tub is
afterwards covered with a blanket, and the wine
is left to ferment in a temperature of from 55° to
60°. In twelve hours, if the fermentation has
begun rapidly, or in twenty-four hours, if it is
slow, the liquor is put into a cask and left to ferment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the bung being put in loosely, and the cask
being kept filled up with fresh must as it works
off. When the hissing noise subsides, the bung is
driven in firmly, and a little hole is made in the
head of the cask, near the bung, which is stopped
with a wooden peg. In two or three days this
peg is loosened to let any air out that may have
been generated; and this is repeated, at intervals,
several times, till no more air escapes, when the
peg is driven in tight. An excellent wine may
be made in a similar manner of the stalks of the
giant tart rhubarb, which, if old, should be peeled
and cut in pieces before they are crushed.</p>

<p><i>Ripe Gooseberry wine</i> is made with hot water;
first crushing the fruit, and, after letting it stand
twenty-four hours, pressing the juice through a
linen cloth. Hot water is then poured over the
marc, in the proportion of two quarts of water to
every gallon of the fruit before it was crushed;
and, after remaining in the tub twelve hours, the
marc is again pressed, and the liquor from it
mixed with that produced by the fruit. Two and
a half or three pounds of lump sugar should now
be added to every gallon of the liquor, and the
whole left to ferment. If moist sugar be used,
the quantity should be four pounds to every
gallon of the liquor. The rest of the process is
the same as before; but when the fermentation
has ceased it is usual to add British brandy, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the proportion of one quart to two gallons and a
half of the wine.</p>

<p>When <i>Currant wine</i> is made, it is said to be
best to boil the liquor after the sugar is added,
before fermenting it in the cask.</p>

<p><i>Elderberry wine</i> is generally made with moist
sugar, and ginger and other spices are added to it.</p>

<p><i>Cowslip wine</i> is made by boiling sugar and
water together, and pouring the liquor over the
rind of lemons and Seville oranges, in the proportion
of four of these fruits to a gallon of sugar
and water: the juice of the oranges and lemons
is added, and the whole is fermented with yeast.
The cowslip flowers are then put into the wine,
in the proportion of one quart to every gallon of
liquor, and stirred up well till they sink. When
the wine is tunned, a few sprigs of sweet briar are
often put into the cask, and one ounce of isinglass
for every gallon of liquor; in a few days it is
bunged up close. In six months it will be fit to
bottle; but it will be better for remaining longer
in the cask.</p>

<p>Any other kind of wine may be made when the
wine is to be made of English fruit, either as was
directed for the green or the ripe gooseberry wines;
and when not made of English fruit, by boiling
sugar and water, and fermenting it, before adding
the substance that is to give the flavour as directed
for the Cowslip wine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cider</i> is made by grinding apples, and then
expressing the juice, which is fermented with
yeast, but without sugar. <i>Perry</i> is made in the
same way; and both may be made on a small
scale by bruising apples or pears in a deep tub,
as was recommended for bruising fruit in made
wines.</p>

<p><i>A brick oven for baking Bread</i> is often placed
in the scullery. The ordinary size of an oven of
this kind is about six feet long by four feet
deep; and it is about eighteen inches high in the
centre of the arch: the floor (which generally
inclines a little from the head of the oven to the
mouth) is laid with tiles, and the arch is formed of
fire-brick, set in fire-clay or in loam mixed with
powdered brick; the whole being surrounded by
a large mass of common brickwork, to keep in the
heat.</p>

<p>When the oven is heated, the faggots, or other
kind of wood which is used for that purpose, are
lighted near the mouth, and then pushed on till
they are as nearly as possible in the centre of the
oven, so that the heat may spread as equally as
possible through every part. When the heat is
between 250° and 300°, it is judged sufficient,
and the fire is drawn out to prepare the oven for
the reception of the bread. As, however, few
cooks can be expected to have a proper kind of
thermometer at hand for ascertaining the heat exactly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
it is necessary to have some easier rules for
judging; and the following, the correctness of
which I have experienced, are taken from the
first volume of that excellent and useful work,
the <i>Magazine of Domestic Economy</i>.</p>

<p>"A judgment must be formed by the clear
red heat of the bricks of the arch and sides of the
oven, and the lively sparkling of the embers on
its floor. The former criterion proves that the
bricks have received enough of body heat to consume
that black carbonaceous coating which the
smoke communicates to them at the early stage of
fire; the second shows that the principle of combustion
is in full activity, and not rendered inert
by a cold surface, either at the top, bottom, or
sides. Finally, if the brickwork be hot enough,
and the point of a long stake be rubbed forcibly
over any part of it, so as for the moment to
make a black trace of charcoal, this trace will be
burnt off, and the bricks left clear in a second of
time."</p>

<p>When the oven is sufficiently hot, the remaining
embers are drawn out with an iron hook fixed
at the end of a long pole, and the bottom of the
oven is cleaned with a wet mop, made of long
shreds of woollen cloth or coarse sacking. The
oven is then quite ready to receive the bread, and
it should be put in immediately. It generally
takes about an hour to heat a moderate-sized oven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
properly; and it takes an hour and a half, or two
hours, to bake loaves of the ordinary size.</p>

<p>Little iron grates are sometimes sold for heating
ovens, but they are more suitable for coal than
wood; and, though an oven may be heated with
great rapidity with coal, it does not retain its heat
so long, and is more fitted for baking French
bread, or cakes, than large-sized household loaves.
When, on the contrary, a brick oven is heated
with wood, and the hot embers are pushed by
the scraper to every part of the oven, the whole
mass of brick becomes what is technically called
soaked, and is in a fit state for a family baking of
bread. When the bread is in, the oven door
should be stopped quite close; but over the door
is a small opening called the stopper, which should
be opened when the bread has been in a little
time, in order that the vapour from the bread may
escape. It is from not attending to this that
home-baked bread is so frequently heavy.</p>

<p><i>Home-baked bread</i> is generally best when made
of what is called grist flour; that is, wheat ground
at a mill, and only the coarse bran removed from
the flour. Twenty-four pounds of this flour will
make about thirty-two pounds of bread; but if
the best white flour is used, two or three more
pounds of it will be required to produce the same
quantity of bread. Bread is made either with
leaven or yeast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Leaven</i> is made by mixing flour with warm
water into a thin paste and then leaving it to
ferment. When it begins to rise in bubbles, more
water and flour is added, and it is again left to
ferment, and then more flour with a little salt is
added to make the dough. The dough must be
kept warm during the whole operation, as fermentation
will not take place unless the heat be
from sixty to seventy, or seventy-five degrees.
Bread of this kind is very light, but it soon becomes
acid. Nearly all the household bread in
France is made in this way.</p>

<p>When <i>yeast</i> is used, the usual proportion is
half a pint of brewer's yeast mixed with a pint of
warm water to twenty-four pounds of flour.</p>

<p>If no fresh yeast can be procured, it may be
made by putting a teacupful of split peas into
a basin and pouring about a pint of boiling
water over them. A cloth is then put over
the basin, and it is set near the fire to keep
warm. In about twelve hours it will begin to
ferment, and a kind of scum will rise, which may
be used as yeast. This is called Turkish yeast;
but a better method is practised by the Americans,
which is as follows:&mdash;Take as much hops as may
be held between the thumb and finger, put them
with a few slices of apples into a quart of water,
and boil the whole for about fifteen or twenty
minutes. Then strain the liquid, and when it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
lukewarm stir in a little flour with three or four
table-spoonfuls of treacle so as to make a thin
paste; then set the whole in a warm place, and in
a few hours the fermentation will be sufficiently
strong to allow enough flour and water to be
added to make a proper sponge for bread.</p>

<p>If you have a small quantity of yeast it may
be increased in the following manner:&mdash;Take
one pound of fine flour, and mix it to the thickness
of gruel with boiling water; add half a pound
of brown sugar, mixing the whole well together.
Then put three table-spoonfuls of yeast into a
large vessel, and pour the mixture upon it. It
will ferment violently, and the scum which rises
to the top will be good yeast, which may be used
immediately, or may be preserved for some time
in an earthenware vessel covered closely from the
air, and kept in a warm dry place.</p>

<p>In the <i>Magazine of Domestic Economy</i> it is said
that when yeast has become sour, and even slightly
putrid, it may be recovered by adding a tea-spoonful
of flour, the same of moist sugar, a pinch
of salt, and a little warm water: this is to be
stirred together and left to ferment for half an
hour. I have never tried this, but it is very nearly
the same as the receipt I have given above. The
yeast from home-brewed beer is very apt to be
bitter; but it is said that this may be cured by
pouring it through a sieve containing about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
pint of bran. To keep home-brewed yeast it
should be put into a large pan and have three
times the quantity of water poured upon it, being
well stirred up, and then left to settle. The next
day the water is to be poured off, and fresh put
on, and in this manner it is said that yeast may
be kept for six weeks. All yeast is best purified
before it is used; that is, the yeast should be put
into a vessel, and cold spring water being poured
upon it, they should be stirred together and then
left to settle. The water is afterwards poured off,
and the yeast taken out carefully, leaving a brown
sediment at the bottom.</p>

<p><i>The best way of keeping yeast</i> is to hang it up
in a cabbage net, so as to let it dry with the air
about it on all sides. This is the way the Germans
prepare their solid yeast, which is now so
much used in London.</p>

<p><i>When bread is to be made</i>, the necessary quantity
of flour is put into a kneading trough, or into
a deep-glazed earthenware pan, and a round hole
is made in the centre for the yeast and water,
which is slightly mixed with the surrounding
flour, so as to form a light batter, and over this is
strewed enough dry flour to cover it. I remember,
when I was a child in my father's house, I have
often watched the cook perform this operation
(which I now find is called setting the sponge); and
I always used to see her, when she had done, make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
a cross in the flour sprinkled over the batter,
without which she declared the bread would never
rise. As soon as the sponge is set, the earthenware
pan is placed before the fire, and a linen
cloth laid over it. In a short time the sponge
begins to rise, and forms cracks in the covering
of flour. More water is then added, heated to
about the warmth of new milk, and salt is scattered
over the flour, which gradually mixes with
the water, kneading it well with the hands so as
to form a fine compact dough. Some dry flour is
then laid under it, and sprinkled over it; and the
dough, being again covered with a cloth, is left to
ferment, which, if the yeast were good, it does in
about an hour, sufficiently to allow the dough to
be made into loaves of bread.</p>

<p>A kind of bread, which is very good for toast
and butter, is made by boiling and mashing some
mealy potatoes, and then rubbing them into flour
which has been previously warmed before the fire,
in the proportion of half a pound of potatoes to
two pounds of flour. When well mixed, add a
proper quantity of salt, with enough yeast, warm
milk, and water to make it into dough. It should
be left to rise for two hours before it is made into
a loaf, and it should be baked in a tin.</p>

<p>For <i>Rolls</i>. Warm an ounce of butter in a pint of
skimmed milk, and add a spoonful and a half of
yeast and a little salt. This will be sufficient for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
two pounds of flour, and will make seven rolls.
The dough should rise before the fire half an hour,
and the rolls should stand another half hour before
the fire after they are made. They should be
baked in a quick oven, and will take about half an
hour. The butter may be omitted.</p>

<p>To make <i>French rolls</i>. Add half an ounce of soda
to the above quantity; make them long in shape,
and rasp them when they are baked.</p>

<p>For <i>Sally Luns</i>. Take two pounds of flour, and
add half a pint of milk and half a pint of cream,
with a bit of butter the size of a walnut; when
a little warm, put to it three well-beaten yolks
of eggs, three or four spoonfuls of well-purified
yeast, and a little salt. Mix the whole together,
and let it rise for an hour; then make it into cakes,
and lay them on tins lightly rubbed over with a
little butter. Let them stand on the hearth to rise
for about twenty minutes, covered with a thin
cloth, then bake them in rather a quick oven.</p>

<p>For <i>Yorkshire</i> or <i>milk cakes</i>. Dry a pound and
a half of flour before the fire; beat up the yolk of
an egg with a spoonful of yeast; add three quarters
of a pint of new milk lukewarm; strain the whole
through a hair sieve into the flour; mix it lightly
into dough, and let it rise by the fire an hour; then
make it up into cakes. Rub the tins with a very
little butter, and let them be warm when you lay
the cakes on them; cover with a thin cloth, and let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
them rise on the hearth about twenty or thirty
minutes; bake them in a brisk oven. This dough
makes very good buns, with the addition of a little
good moist sugar, and a few caraway seeds or
dried currants.</p>

<p>Both the Sally Luns and the milk cakes may
be washed over with the white of an egg before
they are put in the oven.</p>

<p>For <i>Rusks</i>, or <i>Tops and Bottoms</i>. Beat up four
eggs with half a pint of new milk, in which a
quarter of a pound of butter has been melted;
add two table-spoonfuls of yeast, and three ounces
of sugar. Mix with this as much flour as will
make a very light batter, and set it before the fire
for half an hour; then add a little more flour, to
make it stiff enough to work. Knead it well,
and, if wanted for <i>rusks</i>, roll it into cakes about
six inches long and two broad; when baked and
cold, cut them into slices, and dry them in a slow
oven. For <i>tops and bottoms</i>, make the dough into
little square cakes, and flatten them. When baked,
just cut them slightly round, and then tear them
in two, and put them again into the oven.</p>

<p>To make <i>Banbury Cakes</i>. Set a sponge with
two table-spoonfuls of thick purified yeast, half a
pint of warm milk, and a pound of flour. When
risen, mix with it half a pound of currants, well
cleaned and dried, half a tea-spoonful of salt, half
a pound of candied orange and lemon shred small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
one ounce of spice, such as powdered cinnamon,
allspice, ginger, and nutmeg, or mace. Mix the
whole well together with half a pound of honey.
Roll out puff paste a quarter of an inch thick; cut
it into rounds with a tin cutter about four inches
across; lay on each with a spoon a small quantity
of the mixture; close it round with the fingers in
an oval form; place the joining underneath; press
it gently with the hand, and sift sugar over. Bake
them on a baking-plate a quarter of an hour in a
moderate oven, and of a light colour.</p>

<p>For <i>Bath buns</i>. Rub half a pound of butter
in a pound and half of flour, quarter of a pound
of powdered sugar, a little salt, and half an ounce
of caraway seeds. Beat the yolks of four eggs
and three whites; put half a pint of warm milk to
four spoonfuls of good yeast; when settled, pour
it off on the eggs, and mix all into the middle of
the flour till about a third of the flour is mixed
in. Cover it with flannel, and set it before the fire
to rise, about half an hour, then mix all up, and
cover it till well risen. Make up the buns, and set
them before the fire on a baking-tin about a quarter
of an hour; bake them in a quick oven; when
done, brush them over with sugar and beaten egg.</p>

<p>For <i>Oat cakes</i>. Merely mix oatmeal and water
together till about as thick as ordinary dough, then
roll out as thin as possible, and bake on a hot flat
iron called a girdle, hung over the fire. A few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
eggs are sometimes added to make what is called
in Scotland Car cake.</p>

<p>For <i>Muffins</i> and <i>Crumpets</i>. Take a pint and a
half of warm milk and dissolve in it a tea-spoonful
of salt of tartar (subcarbonate of potash), then mix
with it five table-spoonfuls of yeast. When it has
stood to settle, pour it off by degrees, if for crumpets,
into two pounds of flour with a little salt, stir
it well, and then beat it till it looks like a thick
batter, and may be drawn out to a great length
when you lift up the spoon. Set it before the fire
to rise, and when it bubbles up bake the crumpets
on a hot stove, or a girdle. For muffins, take
three pounds of flour, and roll the dough into balls,
and let them rise before putting them on the iron
plate. When the muffins begin to bake they will
spread into the proper shape; and when one side
is done they should be turned on the other side.
The crumpets do not require turning; but if
they are wished to be thick, they may be baked
in an iron hoop. Potato crumpets are made by
adding to three pounds of mealy potatoes boiled
and rubbed through a coarse sieve, half a pound of
flour, an egg, a little salt, and a spoonful of yeast.</p>

<p>For a <i>Brioche</i>. Take a pound of fine flour,
divide it into three parts, to one of which put a
table-spoonful of yeast, mixed with warm water
into a light batter, then set it before a fire if the
weather is cold, and let it rise half an hour. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
warm weather it need not be put to the fire, as it
will rise immediately. Mix the rest of the flour
with a quarter of an ounce of salt, three eggs, a
quarter of a pound of butter, and enough warm
water to make it into a stiff dough. Work it
well, and then add the portion that was previously
prepared. Knead the whole well together, and
then wrap the dough in a white napkin, and leave
it for seven or eight hours. Then divide the
dough into pieces, as if for buns, and make them
into the usual half-twisted form of a brioche, using
a little warm milk to moisten them if necessary.
Lastly, wash them over with eggs well beaten, and
put them in the oven.</p>

<p>I shall now give you two or three receipts for
biscuits, and sweet cakes.</p>

<p>For <i>Butter biscuits</i>. Warm two ounces of butter
in as much skimmed milk as will make a pound of
flour into a stiff paste, knead it well, and beat it
with a paste roller; roll it out thin, cut the paste
into round cakes with a glass, and prick them with
a fork. Bake in a quick oven.</p>

<p><i>Stamped biscuits</i> are made by rubbing a quarter
of a pound of butter into a pound of flour, then mixing
it with cold water and a tea-spoonful of yeast
into a paste. Knead it till it is quite smooth; then
cover it on the board with a basin for half an
hour, and afterwards make it into balls, stamping
each with the print.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Abernethy biscuits</i> may be made by adding caraway
seeds and a very little sugar to the above.</p>

<p>For a <i>Sponge-cake</i>. Take half a pound of
flour, three quarters of a pound of lump sugar
powdered, and seven eggs, leaving out three of the
whites; beat all well together, and add the rind
of a lemon grated on some of the sugar before it
is pounded. Bake in a mould, and in a quick oven.</p>

<p>For <i>Naples biscuits</i>. Put a quarter of a pint of
water, two spoonfuls of orange-flower water, and
half a pound of fine sugar into a saucepan, and
let it boil till the sugar be melted; then pour it
upon four eggs well beaten, stirring the whole as
fast as possible while the syrup is poured in.
Continue beating it well till cold; then stir in half
a pound of flour. Make clean white paper into
moulds of the proper size for the biscuits, pour
the batter into them, and put them on tins to
bake; sift fine sugar on, and set them in a brisk
oven, taking great care that they are not
scorched.</p>

<p>For <i>Wine cakes</i>. Mix two pounds of flour, one
pound of sugar, and one ounce of caraway seeds,
with four eggs, and a few spoonfuls of water to
make a stiff paste; roll it thin, cut the cakes in
any shape, and bake them on floured tins. While
baking, boil half a pound of sugar in half a pint of
water to a thin syrup; and, while both are hot, dip
each cake into it. Put them into the oven on tins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
to dry for a short time; and when the oven is cool
put them in again, and let them remain in four or
five hours.</p>

<p>For a <i>Pound cake</i>. Take two pounds of flour,
one pound of butter, one pound of sugar, one
pound of currants, a little cream, lemon-peel,
mace, and cinnamon; first rub the butter in the
flour, then put in the cream, a little yeast, and
five eggs, and set it to rise; when risen enough
add the other ingredients. Bake in a tin lined with
paper well buttered.</p>

<p>For <i>Ratafia drops</i>. Blanch and beat four
ounces of bitter and two ounces of sweet almonds
with a little rose-water, a pound of sifted sugar,
the whites of two eggs well beaten, and a table-spoonful
of flour. Drop this mixture so as to
form balls about the size of a nutmeg, and bake
them on wafer paper.</p>

<p>For <i>Macaroons</i>. Blanch four ounces of sweet
almonds, and pound them with four spoonfuls of
orange-flower water; whisk the whites of four
eggs to a froth, then mix them, and a pound of
sugar sifted, with the almonds, to a paste; and,
laying a sheet of wafer-paper on a tin, put the
paste on in different moulds, or cut into little
cakes, the shape of macaroons.</p>

<p><i>Gâteau d'Avranches</i>. Grate one pound of loaf
sugar to a fine powder, and add it to the yolks of
fourteen eggs. Beat them well together for half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
an hour, and then add the juice of two lemons,
some orange-flower water, and half a pound of
potato flour. In the mean time another person
must beat the whites of the fourteen eggs for half
an hour or more till they look like snow, as, should
any liquid remain, it will spoil the cake completely.
Put this snow to the yolks, and beat the whole
together for ten minutes; then pour the whole
quickly into a mould that has been well buttered
before the fire, and put it directly into an oven,
which must be hot, but not quite so much so
as for bread; three quarters of an hour will
bake it.</p>

<p>For <i>Gingerbread</i>. Put into a Maslin kettle half
a pound of fresh butter and three quarters of a
pound of treacle, and keep them on the fire, stirring
them together, till they are melted and thoroughly
incorporated. In the mean time mix half
a pound of moist sugar with two pounds of flour
and three quarters of an ounce of ginger, and pour
the treacle and butter quite hot on the flour, sugar,
and ginger; work the whole well together, and
when almost cold roll the paste out, and cut it
into cakes. Bake them in rather a slow oven. If
it is wished to have the gingerbread very rich, only
half the quantity of flour must be used; and the
paste, which is rolled very thin, is cut into squares.
This kind of gingerbread is called Parliament.</p>

PLUM-PUDDING.</h5>


<p>The anxiety you express to see my promised
hints on cookery has induced me to send them
to you without waiting till I had finished all that
I have to say of the servants' offices of your
house; and you will observe that I shall first
confine myself to what may be styled <i>Impromptu
Cookery</i>, or cookery for the country, in contradistinction
to cookery in towns; my principal aim
being to enable you to have a nice little dinner
ready in a short time on any emergency, without
keeping an expensive table in ordinary. I have
already advised you always to have a supply of
salted meat in the house; but this is not enough,
as a single dish of meat with vegetables and
pudding, though quite sufficient as far as regards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
mere eating, does not form such a dinner as your
husband would like to see on his table, if he were
to bring a friend home unexpectedly. If, however,
you are able to give them a well-flavoured
soup, and two or three nicely cooked made-dishes
to support the joint, (or <i>pièce de résistance</i>, as the
French call it,) you have at once a dinner that is
not expensive, and yet gives an air of elegance and
refinement to the table.</p>

<p>I suspect indeed it would be a good plan to have
several dishes on your table every day, whether
you have company or not. It is not more expensive;
for made dishes, by employing more
vegetable matter, actually save the consumption
of solid meat: and it is certainly more wholesome,
as the stomach will more easily digest food of
several kinds than a dinner taken from a single
dish. The French know this perfectly well; and
hence, however heartily a Frenchman may eat,
he is scarcely ever troubled with indigestion, while
many English people find indigestion the misery
of their lives. "The Frenchman," says a writer
on Domestic Economy, "begins his dinner with
light soup, and successively disposes of his four
dishes and his dessert. The whole quantity that
he has eaten is, however, much less than the
Englishman's meal from his single joint, and he
experiences no inconvenience. In eating of a
number of dishes, a little of each, the imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
is acted upon, and exaggerates the quantity really
taken; the appetite is, therefore, satisfied with
much less. The different matters received into
the Frenchman's stomach, independently of their
greater or less approximation to chyme by the
process of cookery they have undergone, form a
light heterogeneous mass or tissue, through which
the gastric juice readily passes, whilst many of the
different varieties he has swallowed act upon each
other as solvents, and help the work of digestion."
Besides, it is well that the servants should be accustomed
to the same style of living when you are
alone as when you have company, to prevent the
awkwardness inevitable when persons do any thing
that they are not in the habit of doing frequently.
One of the greatest dangers of a country life is,
indeed, that of getting into habits of slovenliness,
both of the person and the table. If you once
allow yourself to say, "It is of no consequence
how I dress, or what we have for dinner to-day,
for we are not likely to see any one," all my exhortations
will have been thrown away.</p>

<p>In the first place, in order always to keep up a
good table at a small expense, take care never to
be without plenty of <i>Stock for soup</i>. The best
way of preparing this is to have two or three
pounds of lean beef cut into pieces, and put into
a stewpan with five quarts of water, a bunch of
sweet herbs, two onions sliced, and a little pepper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and salt. Let it stew very gradually for two or
three hours, without being suffered to boil. When
all the goodness is drawn from the meat, the
gravy should be strained off clear and kept in
an earthen jar for use. When a stock like this
has been provided, it is easy to make any kind of
soup from it that may be required. For instance,
if hare soup be wanted, it is only necessary to cut
a hare in pieces, and to let it stew gradually in
this gravy till it becomes tender. If a vegetable
soup be desired, it is simply adding onions, carrots,
and turnips cut into dice, with perhaps a little
celery and a few cabbage lettuces cut small: or
these vegetables may be cut in slices and fried in
butter, and then stewed till tender in the soup,
which should have been previously thickened with
a little butter worked up with flour. On other
occasions, the soup may be varied by adding macaroni,
rice, or vermicelli, or, in fact, any thing
else usually put into soups; or partridges or
giblets may be stewed in it, according to circumstances.
The receipt for this excellent stock is
taken from Dr. Hunter's <i>Receipts in Modern
Cookery</i>; and the following is another from the
same work, of much richer quality, but which I
have also tried and found excellent:&mdash;Take beef,
mutton, and veal, of each equal parts. Cut the
meat into small pieces, and put it into a deep
saucepan with a close cover; the beef at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
bottom, then the mutton, with a piece of lean
bacon, some whole pepper, black and white, a
large onion in slices, and a bundle of sweet herbs.
Over this put the veal. Cover up close, and put
the pan over a slow fire for ten minutes, shaking
it now and then. After this pour on as much
boiling water as will a little more than cover the
meat. Stew gently for the space of eight hours,
then put in two anchovies chopped, and season
with salt to the taste. Strain off and preserve for
use. If properly made, this gravy will become a
rich jelly, which will keep good a long time, and
a piece of which may be cut out occasionally,
when a made dish or a rich soup is wanted in
haste.</p>

<p>The two following receipts for <i>impromptu</i> soups
are from a French cookery book. The first is
called <i>Soup made in an hour</i>. Cut into small
pieces a pound of beef and a pound of veal; put
them into a casserole, or wide shallow saucepan,
with a carrot and an onion cut in slices, a few
slices of bacon, and half a glass of water. Hold
it over the fire for a short time till the meat and
vegetables begin to brown, taking care, however,
that they are not burnt; then pour over the
whole a pint of boiling water, and let the soup
stew gently for about three quarters of an hour;
after which the soup only requires to be strained
through a sieve to be fit for use. The other is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
for <i>Soup made in a minute</i>, and it consists in
taking the congealed gravy from roast meat,
either from the dish or from under the dripping,
after the dripping has become cold and has been
removed, in the proportion of a quarter of a pint
of jelly to a quart of boiling water, and adding
pepper and salt to the taste.</p>

<p>An excellent <i>white soup</i> may be made by boiling
a knuckle of veal down to a strong jelly, with
a bundle of sweet herbs, and another of parsley.
The liquor should then be strained from the meat
and herbs, and flavoured with mace and nutmeg,
adding milk or cream, and thickening with arrow-root.
A few Jerusalem artichokes or young turnips
(particularly the Teltow turnips), boiled quite
soft and rubbed through a sieve, and a little
celery, are a great improvement to this soup.
Partridges stuffed with forcemeat and stewed in
the stock of this soup till they are perfectly tender,
but not so much so as to fall to pieces, make a
delicious dish; but in this case the soup will not
require either to be flavoured with mace and
nutmeg, or to be thickened, unless it is wished
to be very rich. Vegetable marrow or pumpkin,
boiled and rubbed through a sieve, will form a
variety to thicken this soup; or chestnuts boiled,
peeled, and mashed, may be used for that purpose;
celery may also be employed occasionally
to flavour it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p><i>For Hare Soup</i>, cut a large hare into pieces,
and put it into a stewpan with five quarts of
water, one onion, a few corns of white pepper, a
little salt, and some mace. Stew over a slow fire
for two hours, or till it become a good gravy.
Then cut the meat from the back and legs, and
keep it to put into the soup when nearly ready.
Put the bones into the gravy, and stew till the
remainder of the meat is nearly dissolved. Then
strain off the gravy, and put to it two spoonfuls
of soy, or three of mushroom or walnut catsup.
Cayenne pepper to the taste may be added, and
wine in the proportion of half a pint to two quarts
of gravy, if it is wished to make the soup very
rich. Lastly, put in the meat that was cut from
the back and legs, and when it is quite hot send
the soup to table.</p>

<p><i>A Green Peas Soup</i> may be made by taking
six or eight cucumbers pared and sliced, the
blanched part of as many lettuces, a sprig of
mint, two or three onions, a little parsley, some
white pepper and salt, a full pint of young peas,
and half a pound of butter. Let these ingredients
stew gently in their own liquor for an hour.
Then have in readiness a quart of old peas, boiled
tender. Rub them through a cullender, and put
to them two quarts of strong beef gravy. When
the vegetables are sufficiently tender, mix all together,
and serve up the soup very hot. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
receipt is very suitable for the country, where
vegetables are abundant. In this respect you have
a great advantage over the dwellers in towns;
and you will find it easy to make a great variety
of soups, by boiling any kind of vegetable till it
is tender, afterwards rubbing it through a coarse
sieve, so as to make what the French call a
<i>purée</i>, and then mixing it with beef gravy or stock,
as before directed. A <i>purée</i> of old peas or carrots
makes an excellent soup.</p>

<p>I have only to add to my chapter on soups,
that it is an excellent plan to have the bones of a
sirloin of beef or roast leg of mutton, the remains
of a hare, or, in fact, any thing of that kind, put
into a large deep earthen pan, with rather more
than enough water to cover them, a couple of carrots
sliced, and perhaps a leek or an onion. The
pan should then be carefully tied down, or have a
cover fitted on it, and it should be put into an oven
after the bread has been drawn, and suffered to remain
all night. This makes an excellent <i>consommé</i>
or stock for any kind of brown soup: and it is a
good plan to have a stock of this kind prepared
every time there has been a baking of bread, so
as to leave the oven in a proper state; as it not
only saves the purchase of fresh meat for soup,
but makes an excellent use of food that, under
other circumstances, would very probably be
wasted or given to the dogs. The liquor in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
veal or fowls have been boiled should always be
saved, and when cold, after the fat has been removed,
it should be poured off clear from the sediment
and used as a stock for white soups; and
the scrag end of a neck of mutton, the root of a
tongue, and various other portions of beef and
mutton, which would be unsightly if sent to table,
should, also, always be stewed down for brown
soups. In the latter case, if the stock made in
this manner looks pale or dingy, it may have a
rich colour given to it by the following composition
or <i>Roux</i>, which is also useful for made dishes
and sauces. Put a quarter of a pound of lump
sugar into a pan, and add a quarter of a pint of
water, with half an ounce of butter. Set it over
a gentle fire, stirring it with a wooden spoon till
it appears burnt to a bright brown colour; then
add some more water. When it boils, skim, and
afterwards strain it; and then put it into a bottle,
which should be kept closely corked till the composition
is wanted for use.</p>

<p>I shall say nothing about roast meat, or any
of the routine of ordinary cooking; but I shall
confine myself to a few extemporaneous dishes for
the table; and on these occasions the poultry-yard
and the dove-cot will be found of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>Any kind of <i>poultry</i> will be tender if cooked
as soon as it is killed, though it will be tough if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
kept till the following day; and the feathers may
be removed almost instantaneously by dipping the
dead bird for a moment into boiling water. The
only objection to fowls is, that many persons, particularly
gentlemen, are very apt to become tired
of them if they are served too frequently, and
it is therefore advisable to vary the modes of
dressing them as much as possible.</p>

<p>Sometimes a forcemeat may be made for roast
fowl, by boiling about a dozen and a half of sweet
chestnuts, and pounding part of them with the
boiled liver of the fowl, and about a quarter of a
pound of bacon, adding parsley and sweet herbs
chopped very fine, with pepper, salt, and other
spices, to the taste. Fill both the body and the
crop with this mixture, and then roast the fowl;
when it is done, make a sauce by pounding the
remaining chestnuts very smooth, and putting
them with a few spoonfuls of gravy and a glass
of white wine into some melted butter. The
sauce is generally poured over the fowl when it is
served up.</p>

<p><i>A broiled fowl</i> should be split open at the back,
and made as flat as possible, and sometimes the
breast-bone is removed. The thick parts are
generally scored, and seasoned with salt and
pepper, after which it is laid on the gridiron with
the inside of the fowl next the fire. The fowl is,
however, very much improved by putting it, after it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
has been split down and seasoned with pepper and
salt, into a stewpan, with a little butter, and
only enough water to prevent it from burning.
When the fowl has stewed in this manner for
about twenty minutes, it should be laid for about
five minutes over the fire on a gridiron previously
made quite hot, and served with a sauce made of
the liquor in the stewpan, flavoured with mushroom
catsup, or in any other way that may be
preferred. Fresh mushrooms stewed and added
to the liquor are a great improvement to this
dish.</p>

<p><i>For a Dunelm of chickens.</i> Take a few mushrooms,
peeled as if for stewing; mince them very
small, and put to them some butter, salt, and
cream. When put into a saucepan, stir over a
gentle fire till the mushrooms are nearly done;
then add the white part of a roasted fowl, after
being minced very small. When sufficiently
heated, it may be served up. If fresh mushrooms
cannot be had, a very small quantity of mushroom
powder or a little catsup may supply their place.</p>

<p>The French frequently put some rice tied
quite loosely in a cloth into the pot with a
fowl, when it is to be boiled; and, when the fowl
is sufficiently done, they cut it up and <i>fricassee</i>
it, by putting the pieces into a casserole, with a
lump of butter worked into a paste with a dessert-spoonful
of flour and a wine-glassful of water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and the same quantity of new milk, with salt,
white pepper, mace, &amp;c., to the taste. Sometimes
they add mushrooms, and sometimes small Welsh
onions, and artichoke bottoms which have been
previously boiled, to the fricassée; and sometimes
they make the sauce much richer by adding to it
the yolks of four eggs well beaten, in which case
they generally put in a little lemon-juice or a very
small quantity of vinegar, just before serving up.
In the mean time, a little salt is thrown into the
water in which the fowl was boiled, and the rice
is kept simmering in it till the fowl is ready. The
rice is then drained, and, being taken out of the
cloth, is heaped round a dish in the centre of
which the fricassée is put. When the dish is
wished to be of a superior description, only the
best parts of the fowl are used, and the back and
side bones are kept back.</p>

<p><i>Pigeons</i> are still more useful in extemporaneous
cooking than fowls, as, being smaller, they are
sooner cooked; besides, they are said to lose their
flavour when kept. They are very good roasted,
either plain or larded (that is, covered with
slices of fat bacon, over which are put vine leaves
tied on with string): and when the pigeons are nearly
done, the string and the remains of the larding
are taken off, and the birds browned before the
fire. Sometimes they are stuffed with forcemeat
before roasting. Another way of dressing pigeons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
is to cut each in two, and put them into a casserole
with a little butter and a few slices of bacon.
The casserole should then be held over the fire
for a few minutes, shaking it frequently to prevent
the pigeons from burning; and, as soon as they
have acquired a light brown, a few green peas
should be added, and a sufficient quantity of the
simple kind of stock I first mentioned poured
over them to cover the whole. The pigeons
should now stew gradually till they are done, and
then a lump of butter worked into a paste with
flour should be put into the casserole, to thicken
the gravy before dishing up. This is a French
dish called <i>Pigeons aux petits pots</i>; and the following
is another, which is called <i>Pigeons à la crapaudine</i>.
It is made by splitting pigeons down the
back, and flattening them as much as can be done
without breaking the bones too much. The
pieces are then rubbed over with oil, salt, and
pepper; and, some crumbs of bread having been
prepared and mixed with parsley and Welsh
onions chopped very fine, they are rolled in the
mixture so as to be covered with it as much as
possible, and then broiled. Sometimes the pieces
of pigeon are dipped in yolk of egg instead of oil.
They are served with a sauce made of shallots
chopped fine, and mixed with pepper, salt, and
vinegar, with a little melted butter or oil.</p>

<p><i>Ducks</i> and <i>geese</i> are generally best plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
roasted with green peas, or with apple or onion
sauce. Dr. Hunter, however, gives the following
receipt for a savoury sauce for a roasted goose:&mdash;"A
table-spoonful of made mustard, half a tea-spoonful
of Cayenne pepper, and three spoonfuls
of port wine. This mixture is to be made quite
hot, and poured into the body of the goose through
a slit in the apron, just before serving up."</p>

<p><i>Game</i> is generally very abundant in a country
house. <i>Hares</i> may be either roasted, jugged, or
made into soup. <i>Pheasants</i> are generally roasted,
either larded or plain. Dr. Hunter recommends
the inside to be stuffed with the lean part of a
sirloin of beef, minced small and seasoned with
pepper and salt.</p>

<p><i>Partridges</i> are cooked in various ways in
France; but in England they are generally
either roasted, or dressed in the French way
with cabbages. The following is the French
receipt for dressing <i>Perdrix aux choux</i>. Take two
partridges, and put them into a casserole with
butter, a very little flour, three cupfuls of gravy,
a quarter of a pound of fat bacon cut into dice, a
little bunch of sweet herbs and a laurel leaf, and
let them stew gradually. In the mean time boil
a savoy cabbage with three quarters of a pound of
pickled pork, or two spoonfuls of dripping, filling
the pot with water. When the savoy is tender,
take it out and drain it, and then put it into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
casserole with the partridges; let the whole stew
for about half an hour, and then serve it quite hot.
Sometimes a carrot is cut in round slices and stewed
with the partridges, and this is a great improvement.
Care must be taken to remove the bundle
of sweet herbs and the laurel leaf before adding
the cabbage, as otherwise it might be difficult to
find them, and they would not look well if sent
to table. Brussels' sprouts may be used instead
of a savoy, and they render the dish more delicate.
A half-roasted duck may be stewed in this way
instead of the partridges, and is excellent.</p>

<p>Any kind of cold game makes an excellent
<i>salad</i>, the meat being cut from the bones and
mixed with lettuces cut small, and dressed in the
usual manner. The French add capers, anchovies,
or any other seasoning, to salads, and garnish them
with the flowers of the nasturtium and the borage,
which may be eaten without danger.</p>

<p>A <i>Magnonnaise</i> is a salad with alternate rows
of cold fowl or roast veal, and lettuce, hard eggs
cut in quarter slices, or carrot, or beet, gherkins,
anchovy, &amp;c. Cold potatoes cut in slices, and
dressed with oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper, make
an excellent salad, which may be varied by the
addition of fine herbs, slices of beet-root, or anchovies
taken from the bones and chopped fine.
<i>Boulettes</i> of cold meat, chopped small, and mixed
with crumbs of bread or mashed potatoes, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
also very useful <i>impromptu</i> dishes. The mixed
meat and bread or potatoes is seasoned with
pepper, salt, a little parsley, and other herbs, and
a shallot or two cut very small; the yolk of an
egg or two is then added, and the mixture is
made into balls, which are just glazed over with
white of egg, and then fried; after which they are
served with a little gravy or sauce of any kind, or
covered with parsley put before the fire till it is
quite crisp. Cold potatoes may also be cut in
slices and warmed in a casserole, with some butter
mixed first in a plate with a little flour, some
parsley cut very fine, pepper and salt, and a very
little lemon-juice or vinegar: this is called <i>à la
maître d'hôtel</i>. They may also be cut in slices and
fried, and then served with <i>sauce blanche</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sauce blanche</i> is made by mixing butter with
some flour on a plate, and then putting it into a
casserole with a little water. It should be held
over the fire, and frequently shaken, till it boils;
it is then taken off the fire, and a little salt and
vinegar thrown in; after which it is again shaken,
and held over the fire till it is quite hot, but not
boiling, when it is served. Some cooks add a
little of the yolk of eggs, well beaten up with
the salt and vinegar. <i>Carrots</i> are very good
boiled, and then cut in slices, and dressed <i>à la
maître d'hôtel</i>, or fried and served with <i>sauce
blanche</i> like potatoes. Carrots are also very good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
cut into small pieces and stewed till they are
tender, with a little butter, and only just enough
water or gravy to prevent them from burning. A
sauce is made of the yolk of an egg beaten up
with some cream, a little salt being added, and
it is poured on the carrots; the saucepan is then
again put on the fire, and when the whole is quite
hot it is served.</p>

<p>It may be useful here to mention two or three
kinds of sauce which may be used either for cold
meat or fish; and also some of the ways the
French have of dressing cold fowl or veal, which
are very nice.</p>

<p><i>Dutch sour sauce.</i> Take the yolks of two
eggs, a lump of butter, a little bit of mace, and a
table-spoonful of good white-wine vinegar. Put
all together into a saucepan over a gentle fire, and
keep stirring all one way till the sauce is thick
enough for use.</p>

<p><i>Onion sauce.</i> Melt some butter in a little
thick cream, but add neither water nor flour.
Boil the onions, and take two coats from their
outsides. Chop the inside smooth, and put them
into the melted butter, with salt to the taste.
Stir one way over the fire for a quarter of an
hour, and send up the sauce quite hot. Another
way is to boil the onions soft, and to rub their
pulp through a cullender or coarse sieve before
adding it to the butter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sauce à la Bechamel</i> is made by putting sliced
onions and carrots into a saucepan with a little
butter and flour and a pint of cream; pepper, salt,
and nutmeg are added, with mushrooms and finely
chopped parsley, if desired. The whole is suffered
to stew gently three quarters of an hour, and then
it is strained and thickened with a liaison of yolks
of eggs. Another kind is made by adding an
equal quantity of veal stock to the cream; and
dressing any dish <i>à la bechamel</i> means serving it
up with a white sauce; either made as above or in
any other way, provided it consists principally of
cream or thickened milk.</p>

<p><i>Sauce velouté</i> is a white sauce, the base of which
is veal stock instead of cream.</p>

<p><i>A Liaison of eggs</i> is made by taking some fresh
eggs (it is essential that they should be quite
fresh), and separating the white carefully from the
yolk. The yolks are then beaten up, and two or
three spoonfuls of the liquor they are wanted to
thicken is added to them, stirring them carefully.
The saucepan is then taken off the fire while the
eggs are gradually mixed with its contents, and
only put on the fire again for a minute, carefully
stirring the contents so as to make them quite hot,
but not boiling, before they are served up.</p>

<p><i>Sauce à la Tartare</i> is mixed by putting shallots
and other herbs cut very fine, with mustard, salt,
pepper, oil, and a little vinegar. The ingredients<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
are all mixed well together and served cold, or
they may be made hot for fish.</p>

<p><i>A Blanquette</i> is made by cutting cold meat into
thin slices, and then putting it into a saucepan
with a lump of butter, a little flour, pepper, salt,
a bunch of sweet herbs, and a little gravy. Simmer
it gently five minutes, and then put the
meat into a dish; and after thickening the sauce
with the yolks of eggs beaten up with a very
small quantity of vinegar, and putting it over
the fire for a minute, pour it quite hot over the
meat.</p>

<p><i>A Marinade</i> is made by stewing the remains
of a fowl or slices of cold meat with butter
or oil, vinegar, pepper, salt, onions, and sweet
herbs; and then draining the pieces, dipping them
in white of egg, and flouring them or covering
them with bread crumbs, and frying them.</p>

<p><i>A Capilotade</i> is a brown fricassée or hash, and a
<i>Terrine</i> is a pie baked in a dish, but without
crust.</p>

<p><i>Croustades</i> are pieces of stale, firm bread, cut
like sippets, but much thicker, and hollowed out
into the centre, keeping the piece cut out to serve as
a lid. The croustades are then fried a fine brown,
and while hot they are filled with minced fowl or
veal; or if a sweet dish is required, with some
kind of marmalade or jam made hot.</p>

<p><i>Omelettes</i> are always a great addition to a dinner
table, and they are easily made. The following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
is the French receipt for the <i>Omelettes aux fines
herbes</i>. Take any quantity of eggs and beat
them well, adding pepper, salt, parsley, and any
other herbs, with a few shallots or small onions
chopped very fine. Melt enough butter in a
frying-pan to cover the bottom of the frying-pan
with liquid, and when it is boiling pour in the
omelette, and fry it till it becomes a fine brown.
When served, fold it so that only the brown side
may be seen, and pour over it a kind of sauce
made by putting a little butter, flour, and catsup
in the pan, and shaking it for a few minutes over
the fire; or a little gravy may be heated and
poured over it. The frying-pan should not be
too large, as an omelette should always be rather
thick. About six or eight eggs will make an
omelette of the ordinary size, and about two
ounces of butter will be required for frying it.
Other omelettes may be made by omitting the
herbs, and adding mushrooms cut very small, or
mushroom-powder, grated ham, grated cheese, or,
in fact, any other substance that may be thought
desirable.</p>

<p>Dr. Hunter gives the following receipt for a
<i>Potato omelette</i>. Take three ounces of potatoes
mashed, and add to them the yolks of five eggs,
and the whites of three. Add white pepper,
salt, and nutmeg to the taste. Fry in butter, and
serve up with clear gravy, to which some add a
little lemon-juice. Sweet omelettes may be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
by adding to the eggs orange-flower water, and
sugar, or grated lemon-peel and sugar, or marmalade
of apples or apricots, or raspberry or
currant jam. The omelette is then fried in the
usual way; but it is usually served without doubling
it up, sugar being grated over the upper side after
it is put in the dish, which is then set in front of
the fire for a few minutes, or the omelette is
browned by holding over it a flat red-hot iron
called a salamander.</p>

<p>The following is a receipt for making an <i>Omelette
soufflée</i>, taken from a French cookery book.
Break six eggs; separate the whites from the
yolks, and beat up the latter with four ounces of
grated lump-sugar, and a little orange-flower
water, or the rind of a lemon cut very fine, or
grated. Then beat the whites of the eggs into a
froth, and mix them quickly with the yolks, and
pour them into a dish in which two ounces of
butter have been melted, and which is quite hot;
hold a salamander over the eggs for about five
minutes, when they will rise in blisters; then,
sprinkling a little powdered sugar over the dish,
serve it quite hot, without losing a moment, as,
if it be allowed to cool, the puffed up part will
fall, and the appearance of the dish will be spoiled.
When this dish is made in England, the butter is
generally melted in a frying-pan, into which the
eggs are poured, and suffered to fry for a minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
or two, after which the omelette is put into a hot
dish, and set in the oven to rise. A little grated
sugar is then sprinkled over it, and it is served
immediately.</p>

<p>Apples and apricots cut in slices and dipped
in a light batter make a very agreeable addition to
a small dinner; and the flowers of the Judas tree,
and vine leaves, sugared and steeped in brandy,
and the young shoots of the vegetable marrow,
all make nice dishes when dipped in batter and
fried.</p>

<p><i>Frangipane</i> is made by beating up two or three
eggs, and then adding to them two spoonfuls of
flour, mixed quite smooth with a little milk. Put
the whole into a casserole, and set it on the fire for
a quarter of an hour, shaking it continually that
the frangipane may not burn. The dish may
be flavoured with sugar, orange-flower water, or
crushed macaroons; and it is eaten with tarts or
preserved fruit.</p>

<p><i>Fromage à la crème</i> is a very elegant addition
to the dessert. It is made by taking a pint of
new milk, and adding to it a spoonful of rennet,
and keeping it warm till the curd rises; the curd
is then carefully taken up without breaking it,
and laid in a wicker basket, or on a sieve, to
drain. When nearly all the whey has run off,
it is served with cream poured round it, and
sugar grated on the top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>For <i>Syllabubs</i>, to one quart of cream put the
rinds and juice of two lemons, a teacupful of
white wine, two table-spoonfuls of brandy, a little
nutmeg, and sugar to the taste; and then whip
them to a froth with a whisk.</p>

<p>A <i>Devonshire syllabub</i>, or <i>junket</i>, is made by
putting a pint of cider, with two table-spoonfuls
of brandy, and sugar to the taste, into a large
bowl, and milking upon it till the bowl is nearly
full. In twenty minutes some clotted cream is
heaped up in the middle of the dish, and powdered
cinnamon, grated nutmeg, and Harlequin
comfits strewed over the top. When cider cannot
be procured, half a pint of port is used instead,
omitting the brandy; and when a cow is not accessible,
lukewarm milk poured from a coffee-pot
spout, held up as high as possible, will do almost
as well.</p>

<p>For <i>impromptu Cheesecakes</i>. Take a quarter of
a pound of butter, and the same quantity of
pounded lump-sugar, two eggs well beaten, and
the juice of a lemon, with the grated rind. Beat
the butter into a cream, and mix the whole well
together. Then put some light puff paste in
pattypans, and drop a little of the mixture into
each. Another way of making impromptu
cheesecakes is with butter, sugar, and sweet almonds,
taking of each a quarter of a pound, and
adding the yolks of four eggs, with the white of
two, and the grated rind of a lemon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Common Cheesecakes</i> made with curd take more
time to prepare, but are, I think, better; they are
made by turning some milk with rennet into curd,
as if for making cheese, and then beating three
quarters of a pound of the curd, which should be
quite dry so as to crumble, with five ounces of
butter till the mixture is quite smooth. Two
ounces of sweet almonds and five or six bitter ones,
pounded in a mortar, and mixed with four ounces
of lump-sugar, crushed and sifted, should be
added; and the whole should be moistened with
the yolks of four, and the whites of two eggs
beaten up with three spoonfuls of cream, two of
brandy, and a little nutmeg. The pattypans should
be rather large, and rubbed with butter before the
paste is put into them, and the space left for the
curd should be filled quite full. These cheesecakes
should be baked about twenty minutes, and
they are excellent. As I have said you are to line
your pattypans with puff paste, you will probably
now ask how it is to be made. There are numerous
receipts given in the cookery books, and I
really don't know which is the best; but I will tell
you how I have seen most excellent paste made
when I was a girl, by one of the best plain cooks
I ever met with.</p>

<p>For <i>Puff Paste</i>, the flour was put in a wide
earthen pan set before the fire, till it was quite
warm, turning it frequently with the hands. A
little butter was then rubbed into the flour, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
enough warm water was added to make the whole
into a very smooth and even paste, every lump in the
flour having been carefully crumbled in the process
of mixing. The paste was rolled out rather thick,
and little bits of butter stuck all over it; flour
was then dusted over the butter, and the paste was
folded up so as to cover the flour. This was repeated
as often as required, and half a pound of
butter to a pound of flour was considered to make
a very rich crust, a quarter of a pound of butter
to a pound of flour being the usual proportion.</p>

<p><i>Short</i> or <i>Sugar Paste</i> was made by rubbing two
ounces of lump-sugar, crushed by a rolling-pin so
as to be very fine, into a pound of dry flour, and
adding three ounces of butter, both the butter
and the sugar being so mixed as to leave no lumps.
The yolks of two eggs were then beaten up well,
with some cream, and added to the flour, so as to
make it into a paste, and if more moisture was
required, milk or cream was used, but no water.
This paste only required rolling out once, and it
was delicious.</p>

<p>In some of the modern cookery books equal
quantities of butter and flour, in addition to the
yolks of two eggs, are recommended for rich puff
paste; and it is directed that the greater part of
the butter should be made into a ball, and the
buttermilk having been squeezed out of it, it
should be put into the crust and covered with it,
like an apple in making an apple-dumpling. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
crust is then to be floured and rolled out five or
six times. I have never tried this paste, and I
should think it would be difficult to make. Regular
pastrycooks, I am told, use oil, which they
mix with the flour without any water; and lard
or dripping is often used in large families to save
butter. Eggs give a great richness to paste; but
when used the whites should be omitted, as they
are apt to make the paste hard.</p>

<p>Having thus broken through my determination
to give you only receipts for impromptu cookery,
I think I must give you a few hints on what may
be called National Cookery, or, in other words,
that I may teach you how to make the favourite
dishes of most of the nations of Europe. I do this
principally to amuse you, and to enable you to
produce variety in your entertainments, as the
greatest enemy you have to dread is monotony;
but you may occasionally find it useful to know
how to produce the favourite dishes of foreigners,
when you have to entertain them.</p>

<p><i>The Pot au Feu</i> is the popular soup of France,
which is found in every house, from the prince to
the peasant: it is made by putting a solid piece of
beef into cold water, in the proportion of one
pound of meat to a quart of water, and letting it
simmer in an earthen pot on a hot hearth for six
hours, taking off the scum as it rises. A little
salt is thrown in after the liquor has begun to simmer,
and carrots, cabbage, an onion or two, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
any other vegetable that may be in season are put
in, after the scum, caused by the addition of the
salt, has been taken off. This pottage can never be
made properly unless wood is burned in the kitchen,
as it requires to be kept constantly simmering,
but never boiling rapidly during the whole of the
six hours; and this can scarcely be accomplished
with a tin kettle or saucepan placed at the side of
a coal fire. In France they generally use a piece
of the rump for the <i>pot au feu</i>, as they have their
meat (which they call <i>bouilli</i>) sent to table, with
the best of the vegetables, taken carefully out of
the liquor, laid round it. The soup is then strained
off and poured quite hot on a slice of bread, either
toasted or untoasted, according to taste, which is
laid at the bottom of the tureen. Sometimes, instead
of using bread, the pottage is served plain;
or vermicelli is added in the proportion of from
one to two ounces to each quart of soup. The
vermicelli is put into a saucepan, and enough of
the bouillon to cover it is strained over it, and it
is stewed very gently for about half an hour, so as
to be ready to add to the soup when it is put into
the tureen. In winter, instead of vegetables, rice
is frequently put into the <i>pot au feu</i> about two
hours before it is served up; or it is stewed for
about an hour in a separate saucepan, and added
when the pottage is served up.</p>

<p><i>Macaroni</i> is the national dish of Italy, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
prepared by covering it with ten times its volume
of boiling water, and letting it remain till it becomes
soft. When this is the case, some salt is
thrown into the water, and the saucepan is held
over the fire for a minute, till the liquid begins to
bubble, when cold water is thrown in to stop the
ebullition: the macaroni is then drained, and placed
in a dish alternately with small bits of butter,
pepper, and grated cheese; or, instead of butter,
gravy of any kind may be used, or tomato sauce.
The Italians use the same kind of soup as the
French, but they always serve a dish of grated
cheese to eat with it; and sometimes they add
parsley chopped very small to the potage before
serving it. The cheese used in Italy is either
Parmesan or Gruyere, but any strong flavoured,
dry cheese will do.</p>

<p><i>Sauer kraut</i> is the national dish of Germany,
and it is made from very large close cabbages,
which are deprived of their outer leaves so as to
leave only the hard white part, or head. The
first process of preparing them is to scoop out the
interior part of the stalk with an iron instrument
or scoop; they are then cut into small shreds by
a wooden machine, composed of a flat board or
tray, which has a ledge on two sides, to steady a
box or frame, into which the cabbages are put.
In the middle of the board are four flat pieces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
steel, similar to the steel part of a spokeshave,
placed in an oblique direction, and the near edge
of each being a little raised up, with small spaces
between each, to let the shreds fall down into a
tub placed underneath to receive them. The
cabbages are then put into the box before described,
which is pushed backwards and forwards,
when the cabbages, being cut by the steel, fall
in small shreds into the tub placed below. A
barrel stands ready to receive them when cut,
the sides of which are first washed with vinegar.
A man stands on a chair by the barrel, with clean
wooden shoes on, whose business it is to salt and
prepare them, which is done in the following
manner:&mdash;The man first takes as much of the
cut cabbage as covers about four inches above the
bottom; he next strews upon it two handfuls of
salt, one handful of unground pepper, and a small
quantity of salad oil; he then gets into the barrel,
and treads it down with his wooden shoes till it is
well mixed and compact. He next takes another
layer of cabbage, and puts salt and pepper on it
as before, and treads it again, and so goes on till
the barrel is filled. A board is then placed on it,
and upon the board some very heavy weights are
put, and it remains so ten or fifteen days, when
it partially ferments, and a great deal of water
swims on the surface: it is then put into the cellar
for use. The men who prepare sauer kraut are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Tyrolese, and carry their machine on their backs
from house to house.</p>

<p>In the annexed sketch (fig. 6.), <i>a</i> is the cutting-tray,
<i>b</i> the box into which the cabbages are put,

<p><i>The Beet-root soup called Barszez or Barch</i> is
the national dish of Poland. It is made by putting
the siftings of rye into a barrel, and filling it with
warm water in the proportion of three quarts of
siftings to four or five gallons of water. The barrel
is set in a warm closet heated to about 70°, and
soon begins to ferment. In twelve hours it is
ready for use. The liquor is then strained off,
and set near the fire, with any meat or poultry
that may be required. When the meat is sufficiently
stewed it is taken out of the soup, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
after it has been well skimmed and strained, is
mixed with a pint of cream in which four table-spoonfuls
of flour have been beaten up, and into
which a red beet-root has been grated. The soup
is then set on the fire for a minute, and when
quite hot it is served up. The meat is served on
a separate dish, and it is garnished with another
beet-root cut in slices, and dried mushrooms which
have been previously boiled in a separate saucepan.
Another much superior kind of barch, (which
may be called a <i>beet purée</i>,) is made by boiling
several roots of beet, taking care not to break the
skin, so that they may preserve their bright red.
When quite soft they are taken out of the water,
peeled, and rubbed through a sieve. Half a pound
of flour is mixed with a quart of thick sour cream,
and added to five or six pounds' weight of pulp,
and this is thinned with stock from any kind of
meat previously boiled and strained. The whole
is then suffered to simmer till the raw taste of the
flour is gone off, and it is then served quite hot.
It should be of the colour and consistency of
raspberry cream, and, when properly made, it is
delicious. Both these receipts were given to me
by an English lady now residing in Poland, so
that you may rely upon them as being genuine;
and the following receipts for Spanish dishes were
procured for me by a friend from a gentleman
who is a native of Spain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Olla Podrida</i> is decidedly the national dish
of Spain, and, prepared according to the receipt I
am going to give you, it is really excellent. It is
composed of the following ingredients:&mdash;a fowl,
pieces of beef, mutton, veal, and bacon; half a
Spanish sausage, and some garvanzos (Spanish
peas). The garvanzos should be soaked all night in,
warm water and a little salt. Next morning the
whole of the above are to be slowly boiled together
for three hours or more; add some onion, one
or two cloves, salt, carrot, garlic, and open cabbages.
Pour the soup upon <i>very thin pieces</i> of
bread, not toasted. After the soup, the vegetables,
bacon, and sausage are served on one dish, and the
fowl and meat on another. Sometimes vermicelli
or rice is put into the soup instead of the thin
pieces of bread; but the bread appears to be most
generally used.</p>

<p><i>To make a Puchero</i>, put from two to six pounds
of beef into a stew-pan, adding a quart of water for
every pound of meat. Place the saucepan on a
moderate fire, which should be gradually increased
in force so that the scum may be carefully removed,
which should be done as it rises to the
surface until no more of it appears. The saucepan
is then to be left on a fire, kept uniformly moderate,
for the space of four hours. When it has
boiled two hours, put into it three carrots of moderate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
size, two turnips, four leeks, and a parsnep,
each cut in half, a handful of parsley, more or less,
a roasted onion pierced with two or three cloves,
and a good proportion of salt. Warm water must
be occasionally added, according as the soup evaporates.
The above, with the addition of a whole
fowl, or even the half of a chicken only, the giblets
of a turkey, or a bone of roast lamb, makes an
excellent dish in the class of plain cooking. There
should be put in this dish some garvanzos soaked
in warm water the previous night, and put into the
saucepan as soon as the soup begins to get warm.
A piece of ham or bacon, or a piece of the Spanish
sausage, should be put in at the same time as the
vegetables.</p>

<p><i>A Scotch haggis.</i> Take the large stomach of
a sheep. After being nicely cleaned, put it to
soak in cold water for a night. Boil the pluck
of a sheep till it becomes very tender; mince it
small, together with a large portion of suet, and
season with white pepper, salt, and a little onion
shred small; add a quart of the liquor in which the
pluck was boiled, and as much oatmeal, previously
browned before the fire, as will make the mixture
as thick as batter. The ingredients are then
put into the stomach, which must be firmly sewed,
to keep out the water; and, after boiling for
three hours, it is served up in a deep dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Though the pluck is here mentioned generally, we
must observe that neither the liver, nor what is
called the cat's-piece or spleen, is to be used.
When the haggis comes to table a portion of the
skin where it is sewed is taken up with a fork,
and a hole is made by cutting the skin all round
it. If the haggis has been properly made the
gravy will spurt out to a great height the moment
the skin is pierced.</p>

<p><i>Scotch barley broth</i> is considered best when
made with a sheep's head, the wool from which
has been singed off with a red-hot iron. This
operation requires great care, as every particle of
the wool should be removed, and yet no impression
should be made on the skin. When singed the
head should be soaked in water all night. In the
morning it is scraped and washed, and then it is
split open, and the brains taken out. Some persons
rub the brains over the skin of the head to
remove the blackness; but others do not like either
the broth or the head unless both are black. When
properly prepared it is put into a kettle with
some turnips and carrots cut small, some onions,
and some salt; and a gallon of water should be
added, in which a teacupful of Scotch or pearl
barley has been boiled slowly for half an hour.
The whole should then be boiled very gently for
two or three hours, or longer, in a close kettle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
When served the soup should not be strained, but
only the head should be taken out and served on
a separate dish, and the broth should be sent to
table with the barley and vegetables in it. The
meat on the head should be quite tender and
thoroughly done. If the taste of the head be disliked,
the soup may be made by adding to the
stewed barley, the vegetables, and three pounds of
the lean end of a neck of mutton, instead of the
head. A pint of green peas may also be added, if
in season.</p>

<p><i>A Scotch hotch-potch.</i> Take equal quantities of
fresh beef and mutton, a pound and a half of each
to three pints of water; chop them finely, and let
them simmer gently in a stew-pan. When the
meat is tender, season with salt and pepper, and
add a peck of green peas, three or four or more
carrots, two cauliflowers, a few onions, and any
other vegetable that may be in season, cutting
them small, and dredging them with flour. The
whole should stew gradually till the vegetables are
tender, when it should be served without straining.
In the winter, when other vegetables are scarce,
potatoes may be substituted for some of them;
but carrots should always be most abundant.</p>

<p><i>For an Irish stew.</i> Take four pounds of potatoes,
and a pound and a half of meat, with a few
onions, and one carrot, which will make a good
stew for six or seven persons. The meat must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
cut into small pieces; if it is half mutton it will
be all the better; add about three pints of water.
When the greater portion of the potatoes are in
pulp, it will be done. Season it with salt and
pepper.</p>

<p><i>The English national dishes</i> are, I suppose,
roast beef and plum pudding. I need not tell
you how to roast your beef, but I may give you
a receipt for a pudding under it, as I think puddings
of that kind are peculiar to England.</p>

<p><i>For an excellent Yorkshire pudding,</i> take six
eggs, six heaped table-spoonfuls of flour, and one
tea-spoonful of salt. Beat the eggs well, strain
them, and mix them with the flour, and then add
gradually about a pint of milk, so as to make the
whole into a rather thin batter. Warm the pan, and
rub it with dripping or butter before the batter is
poured into it, and let the batter be about an inch
thick. When the pudding is browned on one
side cut it into quarters, or eight pieces, and turn
them to brown the other. In some places the
pudding is made very thin, and not turned; and
sometimes currants are added. A plainer pudding
may be made with half a pound of flour, a tea-spoonful
of salt, three eggs, and a pint of milk.</p>

<p><i>For a Plum pudding,</i> take suet, flour, currants,
and stoned raisins, one pound each, the grated
rind of a lemon, four eggs, a wine-glassful of
brandy, and as much milk as is required to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
it of a proper consistence. It should be boiled
eight or nine hours in either a cloth or a mould,
and served with wine sauce.</p>

<p><i>Sir Joseph Brookes's Plum pudding.</i> "Take
the crumb of a twopenny loaf, six ounces of suet,
two apples grated, three ounces of sugar, the rind
of a lemon grated, a little candied orange, half a
pound of currants, two table-spoonfuls of flour,
the yolks of four eggs, half a nutmeg, a little
ginger, and three table-spoonfuls of brandy. Mix
all well together, and boil two hours. Eight
ounces of apple or gooseberry pulp, with five
ounces of sugar, may be substituted for the
suet."</p>

<p><i>Mr. Sopwith's Victoria pudding.</i> "Take half
a pound of flour, half a pound of currants, a quarter
of a pound of suet shred very fine, a quarter
of a pound of moist sugar, half a pound of mashed
potatoes, a quarter of a pound of carrots boiled
and beaten smooth, and one ounce of lemon-peel.
Mix all well together the night before the pudding
is wanted, and boil it four hours." Another similar
pudding is made as follows:&mdash;"Take of flour, suet
chopped fine, currants, raisins, and grated carrot,
half a pound of each; mix the ingredients well
together, without any liquid, and boil five hours.
A little grated lemon-peel may be added, and the
pudding should be served with sweet sauce poured
over it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall now give you a few miscellaneous receipts
of various kinds, which I know to be good.</p>

<p><i>A Charlotte de pommes</i> is a French apple pudding,
made by lining a mould or dish with thin
slices of stale bread that have been dipped in
clarified butter. The middle is then filled with
apples, stewed as if for sauce; and a piece of
bread being laid on the top, the charlotte is baked
with fire above and below.</p>

<p><i>A French Apple pudding</i> is made by baking or
stewing some apples with sugar till they become a
sort of marmalade. A custard is then made of
half a pound of sweet almonds, blanched and
pounded smooth, with an ounce of bitter ones, half
a pint of cream, the yolks of two eggs, and the
white of one, and poured over the apples, which
should then be baked in a slow oven. As this is
what is called a French apple pudding in England,
it may amuse you to give you now what is called
an English apple pudding in France; it is as
follows:&mdash;Take twelve moderate-sized apples,
pare and core them, and then put them into a
saucepan with four or five table-spoonfuls of
water. Stew them till they are soft, and then
mix them with half a pound of powdered lump
sugar, the juice of three lemons, and the grated
rind of two, and the yolks of eight eggs well
beaten. Mix all well together; cover a dish
with a light puff paste, and pour the mixture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
into it. Put it into the oven, and bake it half an
hour.</p>

<p><i>A Parsnep pudding</i> is made by boiling two
parsneps, draining the water from them, mashing
them, and adding grated bread, the yolks of two
eggs, sugar and spice to the taste, and a little
cream; the whole, when mixed, is poured into a
light puff paste, and baked.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Sopwith's Almond pudding.</i> Take five or
six bitter almonds, blanched, and pound them in a
mortar, with seven or eight pieces of lump sugar.
Then beat up the yolks of two, and the whites of
three eggs, and add them to the almonds and
sugar, with two spoonfuls of cream made lukewarm.
Pour the whole into a mould or basin
well buttered, and steam it for twenty minutes.</p>

<p>To make a <i>Cabinet pudding</i>. Butter a pudding
basin, and line the inside with a layer of raisins
that have been previously stoned. Then cut
some thin bread and butter, taking off the crust,
and fill the basin with it. In another basin beat
up three eggs, and add to them a pint of milk,
with sugar and spice; mix all well together, and
pour the whole into the first basin upon the bread
and butter. Let it stand half an hour, and then
tie a floured cloth over it in the usual manner,
taking care that the basin is quite full. This is a
most delicious pudding; and when turned out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the basin it has a singular appearance, the outside
being quite covered with raisins.</p>

<p>For <i>Lemon cream</i>. Take a quart of lemonade
made very sweet, strain it, and put it in a saucepan
on the fire. Add the yolks of eight eggs
beaten, and stir it always one way till it is of a
proper thickness. Serve it in custard-glasses,
or in a cream-dish. To make the lemonade, dissolve
five ounces of sugar in two pints of boiling
water, having previously, with part of the sugar,
rubbed the yellow rind off a lemon; then add the
juice of three lemons. Some persons put the
lemon and sugar into a jug, and pour the boiling
water upon them.</p>

<p><i>Rice flummery</i>, which is a very nice side dish,
is made by mixing a quarter of a pound of ground
rice with a little cold milk, and then adding a
pint of hot milk which has been boiled with a
stick of cinnamon and a bit of lemon-peel; add
sugar to the taste, and, if required, a few drops of
essence of almonds. Boil it up, stirring it carefully,
and then pour it into a mould.</p>

<p><i>Dutch flummery</i> is made by boiling two ounces
of isinglass in three half-pints of water very
gently for half an hour. Strain the liquor, and
add a few lumps of sugar which have been rubbed
on the rind of two lemons, and the juice of three
lemons strained; then beat the yolks of seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
eggs, and add them gradually. Put the whole
over the fire, and stir it carefully, all one way,
till it boils, and then pour it into a mould, or put
it first into a basin to settle before putting it into
the mould. The whites of the eggs beaten up to
a froth will look very pretty over preserves; or
they may be coloured with some kind of preserve,
to form a dish.</p>

<p>The following is a receipt to make <i>Rice cream</i>,
which was sent to me by a friend, and is said to
be most excellent. Take a quarter of a pound of
ground rice, one quart of cream, the peel of a
lemon, and a small piece of butter. Put all into
a stewpan, and place it over the fire, stirring it
carefully till it boils, when it should be of about
the same thickness as bread sauce. After boiling
two minutes, add a spoonful of prepared isinglass,
and turn it out, as you would any other cream.
Send it to table with a little raspberry or currant
syrup.</p>

<p><i>Blancmange</i> may be made quickly by boiling,
or rather simmering, two ounces of isinglass in
three pints of milk till it is dissolved, which will
be in about half an hour. Then strain it into a
pint and a half of cream; sweeten it, and add a
little peach-water, to give the flavour of almonds.
Let it boil up once, and then stand a few minutes
to settle before it is put into the moulds. Use
tin moulds, and set them in cold pump-water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
changing the water when it becomes warm, and
the blancmange will very soon be quite firm.</p>

<p>I will now give you a few miscellaneous receipts,
and then I think you will have had enough; for
I know, as far as my own experience goes, I have
always felt perplexed, when I have taken up a
cookery book, by the great number of receipts
which I found in it, and all of which appeared to
me so excellent that I knew not which to choose.
I have, naturally enough, supposed you to have
the same feeling; and thus, in what I have written,
I have endeavoured as much as possible to save
you the trouble of selection, by giving you only
such dishes as I either know to be good myself,
or which have been given to me by friends I can
fully rely upon. But I am forgetting your receipts;
they are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>To make <i>Potato flour</i> or <i>starch</i>, to serve also
instead of arrow-root. Peel and wash the potatoes,
cutting out all the specks; then grate or rasp
them into a pan of water; stir it up well, and let
it remain for about ten hours, or till all the flour
is settled down. Then pour off the water with the
fibrous parts of the potatoes, and put some fresh
water to the flour, which, as it settles very hard,
must be well stirred and strained into another
pan, where let it remain till it is again settled
down, and so do till the water is quite clear, which
will be in four or five times mixing in fresh water;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
once straining is sufficient. When clear enough,
break the flour up into a dish, and dry it gently
before the fire; it takes a good while, as it must
be thoroughly dried and broken into a fine
powder. It may then be put away for use, and
keeps a long time. Very small potatoes answer
the purpose as well as large; and, when persons
grow them, it uses up those that are too small for
boiling. Ten ounces and a half of starch have
been produced from very small potatoes, which
weighed only seven pounds and a half before
peeling them. When this flour is made on a large
scale, the potatoes may be washed, and then
ground in a cider-mill without paring.</p>

<p><i>To pickle Lemons.</i> Grate off the rind, then lay
them in salt for six days; boil vinegar with a little
turmeric, and pour over them boiling; let them
stand till next day; then boil in best vinegar, mace,
shallots, anchovy, Cayenne pods, and cloves; boil
the lemons and liquor together two minutes, and
cover them close up. In a few days they will be
fit for use, and are much admired with fish, cutlets,
or cold meat.</p>

<p><i>Mixture for India Pickle.</i> One gallon of vinegar,
a quarter of a pound of garlic, half a pound of salt,
a quarter of a pound of ginger, two ounces of
white mustard seed, and two teaspoonfuls of Cayenne
pepper; mix all well together. Any vegetables,
such as small onions, cauliflowers, French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
beans, radish pods, and gherkins, may be laid in
salt three days, dried, and put into the above
mixture, and it is an excellent pickle for general
use.</p>

<p><i>Cucumber Vinegar.</i> Pare and slice fifteen large
cucumbers, and three or four onions, a few shallots,
and a clove or two of garlic. Then put a layer
of slices of cucumber in a deep jar, and strew
over it some pepper and salt, and a little Cayenne
pepper; then a layer of onions and shallots, with
pepper and salt as before; repeating alternate
layers of cucumbers and onions till the jar is
about half full, when three pints of vinegar is to
be poured on the whole. After standing four
days the vinegar is strained off, and is ready for
use. It is a great improvement to cold meat.</p>

<p><i>Excellent Walnut catsup.</i> Take walnuts of the
size fit for pickling; cut and pound them in a
marble mortar to obtain the juice. To a pint of
this juice put a pound of anchovies. Boil till the
anchovies are dissolved, and then strain through
a piece of muslin. Then boil again, and add a
quarter of an ounce of mace, half a quarter of an
ounce of cloves, some whole white pepper, and
seven or eight shallots, a few cloves of garlic, and
a pint of white wine vinegar. Boil all together
till the shallots become tender; then strain, and,
when cold, bottle for use.</p>

<p><i>Tomato sauce</i> may be made by putting ripe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
tomatoes into an earthen jar, and setting it in an
oven from which the bread has been just drawn.
When the tomatoes have become soft, the skins
should be taken out, and the pulp should be mixed
with vinegar, a few cloves of garlic pounded,
Cayenne pepper, powdered ginger, and salt, to
the taste. Another way is to stew a gallon of ripe
tomatoes with a pound of salt till they are reduced
to a pulp; then rub them through a sieve,
and add half a drachm of cochineal, and Cayenne
pepper, mace, allspice, and ginger to the taste.
Let the whole boil gently for twenty minutes,
and when cold put into wide-mouthed bottles for
use. By adding a little brandy to each bottle,
this sauce will keep several years. Tomatoes are
also very good, boiled gently in salt and water.</p>

<p><i>For Tomato sauce</i> (<i>the Spanish way</i>). Cut
six tomatoes in half, and, having pressed out
their juice, put to them a sufficient quantity of
gravy, a quarter of a head of garlic, a little parsley,
and a few drops of vinegar. All this must
be boiled together for a short time and passed
through a sieve. This sauce is a great improvement
to mutton chops, ham, boiled beef, or beef
steaks.</p>

<p><i>The Spanish mode of keeping Tomatoes.</i> Boil
some sugar, in the proportion of an ounce to each
tomato, until it becomes candied. Add a tenth
part of onions; and when they begin to colour put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
in the tomatoes, with salt, pepper, cloves, and
nutmeg in suitable quantities. Boil the whole
on a very quick fire, and, when of sufficient thickness,
strain it through a hair-sieve. Place it on
the fire again immediately, and, when it becomes
solid, put it into jelly-pots. These must be
covered with two plies of paper, and kept apart
from the light. The onions may be omitted from
the above; in which case it can be used as a sauce
for a variety of dishes.</p>

<p><i>Sirop de Cerises.</i> Prepare some ripe cherries
by pulling out their stalks, crush them, and leave
them to ferment for twenty-four hours. Press
the cherries, and strain their juice through a sieve.
The liquid should be quite clear, and to every
seventeen ounces of juice add two pounds of lump
sugar. Put the liquid into a stewpan on the fire,
and let it boil once, then take off the scum, and
when the liquor is nearly cold bottle it. All other
syrups of fruit are made in the same manner.</p>

<p>I think you will now be as much tired of reading
receipts for cookery as I am of writing them,
and therefore I will only add two receipts for
making <i>Pork pies</i>, the first of which is the mode
practised in my native county, Warwickshire.</p>

<p>Half a pound of lard is put into a saucepan
containing a quart of water. The saucepan is
set on the fire, and stirred till the water boils.
The boiling lard and water is then poured slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
into as much flour as will suffice to make it into
a smooth and very stiff paste, and mixed with
a wooden spoon, after which it must be beaten
with a rolling-pin. When the ingredients are
thoroughly incorporated, the paste is put into an
earthen pan, covered with a linen cloth, and
placed near the fire, where it is left for about
half an hour. The meat is now prepared by being
separated from every particle of bone, skin, and
gristle, and cut into pieces about the size of dice.
Care is taken to keep the fat and lean separate;
but both are well seasoned with pepper and salt.
A piece of the paste large enough to form one
pie is then broken off the mass, and the rest is
again covered up, as it cannot be worked if it is
too cold, though it will not stand if it is too warm.
If it breaks and crumbles, instead of being plastic,
it is too cold; and if it is too soft, and falls when
raised, it is either too warm or too rich. When
it is of just the right heat to bear being moulded,
and yet to retain whatever shape may be given
to it, the piece of paste is worked with the hands
on a pasteboard, into the form of a high-peaked
hat, with a broad brim; and then the peak of the
hat being turned downwards on the board, one
of the hands is put inside the hat, and the other
used to raise and smooth the sides, till the pie is
gradually worked into a proper shape. The meat
is then put into the crust in layers, two of lean to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
one of fat, and pressed as closely as possible, in
order that the pie may cut firm when cold. When
the pie is quite full, the lid is put on, and wet
round the edge to make it adhere to the top of
the walls, on which it is laid, the two being
pinched together, in order to unite them more
thoroughly.</p>

<p>In Leicestershire, and some parts of Staffordshire,
a layer of raisins is often put below the meat,
and, in Northamptonshire, pork pies or pasties are
made with the same kind of crust as I have described,
but, instead of being raised, it is rolled
out, and then cut into pieces of a proper size for
the top and bottom, with a long piece of the
necessary width for the sides. The bottom is
cemented to the walls with egg, the two parts
which are to adhere being pinched together; and
the crust is filled with well-seasoned meat, put in
layers of fat and lean as before; the lid is then
put on, and, after it has been made to adhere to
the walls, it is washed over with a feather dipped
in white of egg.</p>

<p>These pies are frequently baked in a tin,
which is made so as only to support the walls,
and is fastened on one side with a kind of skewer,
which may be drawn out, so as to allow the tin
to be removed without breaking the crust. As,
however, the sides sometimes look too pale, when
the pie is baked in a tin, the pie may be put into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the oven again for a few minutes after the tin is
removed, in order that the walls may be properly
browned.</p>

<p>All pork pies should be baked slowly, on account
of the solid nature of the meat; and a hole
is generally made in the middle of the lid to let
out the steam. No water should be put into the
pie when it is made; but, when it is baked, a
little gravy made from the bones of the pork may
be poured in through the hole in the lid. Pork
pies are never cut till they are cold. Those
persons who dislike lard may use butter instead
of it for the crust; but it is not quite so good.</p>

<h5>THE LARDER.&mdash;SALTING MEAT, BACON, AND HAMS.&mdash;THE
DAIRY.&mdash;MANAGEMENT OF MILK.&mdash;MAKING AND KEEPING
BUTTER.&mdash;MAKING CHEESE OF VARIOUS KINDS.&mdash;ICE-HOUSE,
ICE-CELLAR, AND ICE-COOLER.</h5>


<p>I will now proceed to say a few words on the
other servants' offices. The <i>Larder</i> in a country
house is generally a square or oblong room near
the kitchen, and sometimes sunk a step below it.
It should be kept as cool as possible, and should
be contrived to be on the north side of the house.
Where practicable, there should be two windows,
or rather openings in the walls, opposite each other,
filled in with wire network instead of glass, to
allow a free current of air through the room, and
yet to exclude flies and other insects. The floor
should be of brick, and furnished with a drain, so
that it may be frequently washed with plenty of
water, without much trouble. The walls should
be whitewashed, and there should be fixed in them
at intervals strong iron hooks or holdfasts, for
the purpose of suspending uncooked meat. Other
hooks should be fixed in the ceiling, for hung beef,
tongues, hams, &amp;c. When the larder is dry, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
may be also bacon racks fixed to the ceiling; but,
if the situation should be damp, these will be
better in the kitchen. In some places a circular
rack is hung in the centre with hooks round it for
game; but in very large establishments there is a
separate larder for game, as the smell, when it is
high, gives an unpleasant flavour to the fresh
meat kept near it. In the centre of the larder
there should be a strong wooden table or chopping-block
for cutting the meat upon; and close
under the walls there is frequently a raised settlice
or dais of brick, about two feet high, which serves
to support earthen, slate, or wooden troughs for
salting meat. In one of the deepest of these should
be a kind of pickle or brine, in which anything
that is to be salted for keeping may be put; and
the other more shallow troughs may be employed
for slightly salting meat that is soon to be used.</p>

<p>The pickle for the large brine trough is made by
mixing four gallons of water with a pound or a
pound and a half of coarse sugar, four ounces
of saltpetre, and six pounds of common or bay salt.
This mixture should be boiled in a large kettle,
and the scum taken off as it rises. When no more
scum appears, the vessel should be taken from the
fire, and the liquid suffered to stand till it is cold.
Another pickle is made by adding to four gallons
of water, fourteen pounds of common salt, eight
pounds of bay salt, half a pound of saltpetre, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
two ounces of sal prunella. Boil the whole together
for half an hour, and take off the scum; when
cold it is fit for use. The first kind is best for
hung beef and tongues; and the latter for salt
beef and pickled pork.</p>

<p>When the pickle is ready, the meat to be salted
should be examined, and carefully wiped dry with
a coarse cloth, any flyblows or bruised parts being
removed. If tongues are to be salted, the roots
should be cut off, and laid aside for soups; and
then the tongues should be scraped and rubbed
dry before putting them into the pickling-trough.
The skin of the pork should be scraped and
cleaned, and the fleshy part should be carefully
examined, and wiped dry, any mass that there
may be of congealed blood being removed. All
the meat that is to be cured being properly prepared,
it should be laid in the pickling-trough and
the brine poured over it; and, if there are several
pieces of meat, care should be taken to lay them
so that the brine may touch every part, and completely
cover the whole. Meat which has been
preserved in the first pickle for ten weeks or more,
if cooked without being hung up to dry, will be
perfectly tender, and will eat as well as meat that
has been only freshly and slightly salted.</p>

<p>It is said that meat may be kept in this pickle
for twelve months, provided the pickle be boiled
and skimmed about once in two months, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
during the boiling, two ounces of sugar, and half
a pound of salt be added. In general, the articles
which have been salted, after remaining about a
fortnight or three weeks in the pickle, are taken
out and hung up to dry. Some persons lay them
to drain, and then hang them up without any other
preparation; but others advise them to be wiped
quite dry and put in paper bags before they are
hung up. Whenever fresh articles are put into
the pickle, every thing should be taken out of the
trough, and the brine boiled up, the scum being
taken off and fresh salt and sugar added, as before
directed. Sometimes meat is merely salted
when it is to be used in a few days; in which
case the meat is put into a smaller trough or pan,
and only salt is used in the proportion of a quarter
of a pound of salt to every two pounds of meat.
The salt should be well rubbed in, and the meat
turned every day.</p>

<p>The following general observations as to curing
meat will probably be of more use than multiplying
receipts. What is called bay salt (that is,
salt made by evaporating sea-water) gives a finer
flavour than common salt, but rather more should
be used, to produce the same degree of saltness.
Sugar makes meat tender, and gives mellowness
and richness, but the quantity used should never
be more than one quarter of the quantity of salt,
or it will make the meat taste insipid. Saltpetre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
gives a fine red colour, but it is apt to make the
meat hard; and, whenever it is used, there should
be at least an equal quantity of sugar to counteract
its hardening tendency. The usual proportion
is, a quarter of an ounce of saltpetre to a
pound of salt; or, if used with sugar, one ounce of
saltpetre to three pounds of sugar. Meat should
never be salted in very hot weather, unless it is
wanted for use in a few days; and it should
never be put in pickle at that season. If any
meat in the slightest degree tainted be put into
the pickling-trough, the brine will be spoiled,
and should be thrown away. When it is absolutely
necessary, in very hot weather, to salt meat
to keep, it is said that a tea-spoonful of muriatic
acid and of nitric acid (spirits of salt and aquafortis),
in equal parts, should be added to every
pound of salt. It is also said that a dessert-spoonful
of pyroligneous acid added to every
pound of salt will give a fine smoky flavour, without
any of the trouble attendant on smoking dried
meat; but this last must be used with great care,
as too much would spoil the meat.</p>

<p>As <i>Hams</i> require to be salted with more care
than any other kind of meat, I have given below
two or three particular receipts for curing them,
all of which I know to be excellent. The first is
very useful in the country, as the hams cured by
it may be cooked without steeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>For a ham twenty-four pounds in weight, take
two ounces of saltpetre, half a pound of common
salt, one pound of bay salt, and one ounce of black
pepper. Mix these together, and rub them well into
the ham: then let it stand three days, and at the
expiration of that time pour one pound of treacle
over it, and let it remain twenty-four hours;
after that time, let it be turned every day for a
month, and each time rub the liquor well into it.
After this, steep the ham in cold water for twelve
hours, then dry it well and hang it up. It will
not require any further steeping when it is to be
boiled; and it should be boiled slowly, say at
the rate of about three hours for a ham of the
weight of ten pounds. This receipt was given
me by Mr. Beaton, and it is impossible for any
hams to be better than those cured in this way.</p>

<p>The following is the way of curing hams to
give them the Westphalian flavour. For two
large hams, take one pound and a quarter of
common salt, two ounces and a half of saltpetre,
three pounds of bay salt, one pound and a half of
brown sugar, and one quart of old beer; boil them
all together, and pour the mixture over the hams
boiling hot. Turn them and rub them well every
day for sixteen days; then smoke them with short
horse-litter, and hang them up to dry.</p>

<p>The following is another mode of giving hams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the Westphalian flavour, and it is said to be excellent.
For two hams weighing thirty pounds,
take one pound of common salt, half a pound of
bay salt, three ounces of saltpetre, and one ounce
and a half of black pepper, the latter ground, and
finely sifted. Mix all these well together, and rub
the hams with the mixture for four days, turning
them every day, and having first washed them
well with vinegar. On the fifth day, pour over
the hams two pounds of treacle, and rub them
well with two ounces of juniper berries bruised.
Let them remain in this pickle six weeks, turning
and rubbing them daily; then take them out of
the pickle, and lay them in spring water for four-and-twenty
hours; then wipe them dry and send
them to a chimney where wood is burnt. When
thoroughly smoked, take them down and put
them in a chest with wood ashes. I may here
observe that, when hams are cured in any ordinary
way, it is said that the Westphalian flavour may
be given to them by rubbing over them three
table-spoonfuls of a mixture of tar and spirits of
wine, when they are just taken out of the pickle.</p>

<p>The following is a mode of making <i>Mutton
hams</i>, which some persons are very fond of, though
they are too strong for delicate stomachs. Cut a
hind quarter of mutton like a ham, and rub it
with one ounce of saltpetre, one pound of sugar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
and one pound of salt. Lay it in a pan, with the
skin downwards for a fortnight, then roll it in
bran, and hang it up to dry.</p>

<p>In some places there is no regular larder, but
the uncooked meat is kept in a hanging <i>Safe</i> in
the open air, which is drawn up and down by a
pulley. Cooked meat is either kept in a similar
safe, in a fixed safe, in a separate room called a
dry larder, or on a table in the centre of the
common or wet larder; but, in the latter case,
every dish should be covered with a wire-cloth
cover to keep off the flies. In many places the
salting-room is apart from the larder, and this is a
great improvement.</p>

<p>The <i>Dairy</i> should have thick walls, and a brick
or stone floor, so contrived that it may be washed
with abundance of water every day, and yet have
all the water run off by means of a waste-pipe or
drain. There should be a kind of shelf of stone
or slate round it, about four feet from the ground,
and a table of similar materials in the centre, for
the convenience of holding the vessels containing
the milk and cream; and the window, if there is
but one, should look towards the north, and be
filled in with wire-cloth, so as to admit the air
and yet exclude the flies and other insects. Besides
this wirework, the window should also have
either a sash frame with ground glass to open
inside, or outside shutters, to exclude the sun in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
very hot weather, and the cold in winter. A
thermometer should be kept in every dairy, and
the heat should never be allowed to rise above
55°, or to fall below 50°. There should always
be a scullery attached to the dairy containing a
fireplace and boiler, as the vessels in which milk
is kept require to be frequently washed with
scalding-hot water to keep the milk sweet, and
to prevent the butter and cream from acquiring
an unpleasant taste.</p>

<p>Though I do not imagine your knowledge of a
dairy to be very great, I suppose you are aware that
the milk is drawn from the cow into a can or
wooden pail, and brought into the dairy, where it
is strained, and then put into shallow vessels or
milk-pans, in which it is left for several hours
in order that the cream may rise. Cows are
generally milked twice a day; the morning's milk
being skimmed in the afternoon, when the afternoon's
milk is put into pans, or set up as the
dairy-maids call it, and the afternoon's milk being
skimmed in the morning. The cream, after what
is wanted for the table has been taken out, is put
into a large wide-mouthed jar or stein, and saved
for butter. Cheese is generally made of new
milk, which is put at once into the cheese-tub
without setting it up in pans. The cheese-tub
and cheese-press, the churn and all the apparatus
for making butter, generally stand in the dairy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
scullery, where the operations of cheese and
butter making are carried on.</p>

<p>Various kinds of vessels have been recommended
for milk, and they have been made of
lead, zinc, slate, and other materials. China are the
best; but the old-fashioned wooden or earthenware
pans appear to be the most general favourites; the
only objections being, that wooden pans require
a great deal of care to keep them clean, and that
the leaden glaze of the earthenware pans is apt to
be affected by the acid of the milk, if it should be
kept till it becomes sour. No good dairy-maid,
however, would ever keep milk in her pans till it
became acid: and, if by any chance wooden vessels
became tainted by having had in them sour or
otherwise spoiled milk, they should be soaked in
water in which a large piece of soda has been dissolved;
and, if this does not sweeten them, they
must be boiled in soda and water, and then immersed
in pure cold water for a day or two.</p>

<p>Milk when drawn from the cow is warm, and
it should be set up in the dairy before it is quite
cold, or the <i>Cream</i> will not rise properly. Cream
for butter may stand twelve hours on the milk,
but the cream that rises in two or three hours
after the milk is set is considered the richest. In
many places the milk is skimmed twice, the second
time twelve hours after the first; but the second
skimming is considered very inferior to the first.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
In Devonshire, the dairy-maids set the milk-pans
on a hot hearth, in order to raise the rich cream
peculiar to that county.</p>

<p>In Scotland, <i>Butter</i> is made by churning the
whole of the milk, which is put into the churn
as it comes from the cow, and kept there till
it is slightly sour before it is churned; but this
makes the operation of churning very laborious,
and the butter has always a sour taste. In England,
butter is made only from the cream, which
is not put into the churn till wanted for churning,
but is kept previously from three days to a week
in a deep earthen vessel, and is stirred every day
when fresh cream is put in.</p>

<p>Churns are of two kinds, viz. the plunge-churn,
the motion of which is up and down; and the
barrel-churn, which turns round, and is considered
much the best. Churning is generally performed
in the open air in summer, and in the dairy
scullery near the fire in winter. If kept too
cold, the butter will not "come;" and, if too hot,
the butter will be soft, and will soon become
rancid.</p>

<p>When the butter has come, as the dairy-maids
call it, it is gathered together with the hand or
a net, and put into a kind of shallow tub; the
buttermilk is then emptied out of the churn,
which should be left to drain for half an hour or
thereabouts, and be afterwards well washed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
scalding water and a little salt. The butter in
the mean time is kneaded and worked with the
hand, or with two small and very smooth pieces of
wood, to get all the buttermilk out of it; and in
England water is generally poured over it to assist
in this operation, though in Scotland it is said
that water spoils the butter. When all the
buttermilk is worked out, the butter is slightly
salted, and then made up into rolls or lumps with
the two pieces of wood. In the South of England,
as soon as the butter is made, it is put into water;
but in the North it is laid in a dry cool place, and
covered over.</p>

<p>When butter is intended for salting, it is not
made into rolls, but the salt is worked into it as
soon as the buttermilk has been removed. The
following composition is recommended as a very
good one for salting butter for home use. Take
two parts of salt, one part of lump sugar, and one
part of saltpetre. Beat them well together, and
add one ounce of this composition to every sixteen
ounces of butter.</p>

<p>When cows are fed on turnips, an unpleasant
taste is given both to the milk and butter; but it
may generally be removed in the following manner.
Pour a quart of boiling water on two ounces of
saltpetre, and, when it is thoroughly dissolved and
cold, bottle it for use. If two table-spoonfuls of
this mixture be put to every four gallons of milk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
as soon as it is brought into the dairy and strained,
it is said to take off the unpleasant taste; or a
lump of saltpetre about the size of a walnut may
be put into the cream-pot and well stirred twice
a day, when the fresh cream is added. In winter,
butter is sometimes so pale as to look almost like
lard, but it may be coloured by a little arnatto,
which is sold for that purpose in the grocers'
shops; or the juice of carrot scraped and strained
through muslin, or that of the flowers of the marigold,
may be used. In either case the colouring
matter is mixed with the cream before churning.</p>

<p><i>Cheese</i> is made by coagulating milk with rennet,
and then separating the whey or watery part from
the curd, which, when salted, pressed, and dried,
becomes cheese. Rennet is the stomach of a calf
washed, cleaned, and salted thoroughly inside and
out, being left in an earthen jar, with a thick
coating of salt on it, for three or four days. It is
then taken out of the pickle and hung up to dry,
and in many places it is kept in this state till
wanted; but in others, after it has become dry, it
is resalted and placed again in the jar, which has
a bladder or a piece of thick paper pierced with pinholes
tied over it, the rennet being kept twelve
months in this state before it is used. In London,
calves' stomachs and those of lambs, prepared for
rennet, are kept in large casks and sold in the
oilmen's shops. In whatever way the rennet has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
been pickled and preserved, it is always soaked in
brine made of salt and water or salt and whey,
before it is used, and a bunch of sweet herbs is
generally put into the brine in which the rennet is
soaked, in order to give an agreeable flavour to
the cheese. The whole, however, must be strained
off clear before it is put to the milk.</p>

<p>Whenever cheese is to be made, the milk must
be warmed to about 90° of Fahrenheit, or the
rennet will not act. As soon as the curd has
set, it is separated from the whey in several different
ways, and on the manner in which this is
done the kind of cheese produced will principally
depend. When a <i>Stilton</i>, or any other kind
of rich buttery cheese, is to be made, a very
strong brine is prepared of salt and cold water, in
which is steeped a bundle of sweet herbs, consisting
of thyme, hyssop, marjoram, and savory,
with a branch of sweet-briar, and a few peppercorns.
This is suffered to remain three or four
days, after which it is strained off, and the rennet
having been put into it and soaked four or five
days, is then ready for use. When all is prepared,
the morning's new milk, together with the cream
from the last night's milking, is put into a narrow,
but deep, circular pan, and the liquid rennet put
to it.</p>

<p>As soon as the curd is formed, it is very carefully
removed from the pan, without breaking it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
if possible, and laid on a deep circular sieve,
where it is slightly pressed, in order that the whey
may drain from it. It is then put into the cheese-vat,
which should be ten inches and a half deep,
and eight inches and a quarter over, with a moveable
hoop of wood on the top, over which a piece
of flat board is generally laid. As soon as the
cheese has acquired a sufficient consistency, it is
removed from the vat and firmly bound round
with a clean cloth, which is changed every day,
and the cheese bound tighter and tighter, till at
last it becomes sufficiently firm to stand alone.
Every time the cloth is changed, the cheese is
wiped at the top and bottom and turned, so that
each end may be equally level. When it has
become sufficiently firm to support itself without
the cloth, the cheese is removed to the cheese-room;
but it still requires to be turned twice a
day, and brushed, for about three months.</p>

<p><i>Single and double Gloucester cheeses</i> are made
very differently from Stilton, though the rennet is
prepared for both in nearly the same manner, except
that some allspice and a little saltpetre are
generally added to the brine. In some places the
brine is made of whey, in which enough salt is put
to make it float an egg; but it is said that cheeses
made in this manner are very apt to heave.</p>

<p>The best <i>single Gloucester</i> cheese for toasting is
what is called a one-meal cheese; that is to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
it is made entirely of new milk taken fresh from
the cow. An inferior kind is called a two-meal
cheese, and it is made with the evening's milk
after it has been skimmed in the morning, mixed
with the morning's new milk. The milk is then
warmed, and coloured with a little arnatto, care
being taken, however, that none of the solid part
of the drug goes into the milk; the usual practice,
indeed, is to dip the arnatto in a little milk,
and then to rub it on a flat stone or plate. The
colouring matter thus produced is washed off into
a basinful of milk, which is then allowed to stand
and settle, so as to deposit its sediment before it
is poured into the cheese-tub. The rennet is then
added, and the whole is kept moderately warm
(the milk should never sink below 80°) till the
curd is come, which is generally in about an hour.
The curd is then broken up with a flat piece of
wood called a cheese-knife, and the whey is
strained from it; the fragments of curd being
frequently moved about, to allow the whey to
escape from them. Some boiling water is then
mixed with a little of the cold whey, and poured
quite hot upon the curd, so as to cover it, the
curd being stirred briskly about, and afterwards
left for half an hour to sink. The liquor is then
drained off, and the curd taken up by the hands
and carefully squeezed as it is put into the cheese-vat,
which is not only filled, but has as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
piled on the top as it will hold. When this is
done, the curd in and on the vat is turned into
a cheese-cloth, and the vat is washed with whey.
The cloth, with the curd in it, is next placed in
the vat, and the ends of the cloth are turned over
the top of the curd, and tucked into the vat round
the edges. It is then put into the cheese-press,
where it remains about three hours, after which
it is taken out and the cloth changed, before it
is again put into the vat and into the press. In
this state it remains three or four hours longer.
It is then taken out of the vat and out of the
cloth, and rubbed well with salt all over, taking
care that the salt touches every part, after which it
is put into the vat without a cloth, and replaced in
the press. The next morning it is taken out of the
press and again salted and turned, and the same
operation is repeated in the evening. After this it
is suffered to remain five or six days in the press,
being taken out every morning and turned, but
not salted. It is then removed to the cheese-room,
where it is turned every day for ten or twelve days,
and frequently scraped and rubbed. In some places,
when the cheese is thoroughly dry, the outer rind
is painted with a mixture of Spanish brown and
Indian pink, rubbed in with the hand. The whey
from this cheese produces a great deal of butter;
and, indeed, it is generally set up for cream as
soon as it comes from the curd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>double Gloucester cheese</i> is always made
with one meal's milk warm from the cow, and the
dairy-maids generally put a lemon, stuck with
cloves, into the brine in which they steep their
rennet. The cheese-making then proceeds in the
same manner as for the single Gloucester, except
that, when about half the curd has been put into
the vat, an ounce of salt is sprinkled over it before
the rest of the curd is put in. The remainder
of the operation is the same as for the single Gloucester;
the principal difference being in the
thickness of the cheese, which, of course, is occasioned
by the greater depth of the vat in which
the curd is put.</p>

<p>In many parts of Gloucestershire, what is
called <i>Sage cheese</i> is made. For this a couple of
handfuls of sage leaves and a handful of parsley
are generally put into a portion of the evening's
milk, and suffered to remain all night. In the
morning the milk is warmed, and, after being
strained from the leaves, it is turned to curd with
the rennet in the usual way. In the mean time
a portion of the morning's milk, into which no
colouring matter is put, is turned to curd by
rennet; and the curds of both kinds are kept
separate through the processes of draining and
scalding, till they are ready to be put into the
vat, when they are mixed according to the fancy
of the dairy-maid. Sometimes the green curd is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
pressed into a tin or wooden mould, so as to form
a dolphin or some other fanciful figure; in which
case it is taken carefully out of the mould, and
put into the vat without breaking it, and the white
curd is crumbled between the fingers and pressed
carefully and firmly round it. In other cases the
sage and parsley leaves are only bruised, and the
juice which is pressed from them is mingled with
a portion of the morning's milk; or one portion
of the milk is coloured red with the juice of boiled
beet-root, another green with the juice from spinach
leaves flavoured with sage, and another yellow
with the bruised petals of the marigold. Portions
of milk are coloured with these different substances
and coagulated separately, the curd being
varied when putting into the vat, according to
the fancy of the dairy-maid. In other cases the
whole of the milk is coloured and flavoured with
sage.</p>

<p><i>Cheshire cheeses</i> are generally very large, most
of those made in spring being one hundredweight
each. The rennet for a Cheshire cheese is not
considered fit for use till it is three years old. It
is soaked in warm water the night before it is
wanted, and in the morning the liquor is considered
ready without any further preparation.
The evening's milk is set up for cream in the
usual way, and in the morning the cream is taken
off and put into a brass bowl made hot by rinsing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
it with boiling water. A third part of the skimmed
milk is then put into another brass bowl, warmed
in the same manner; and the two are put into
the cheese-tub, and mixed with the morning's
milk warm from the cow. The whole is coloured
with the juice of scraped carrots, or of the bruised
flowers of the marigold. The liquor from the
rennet is then added, and, being well stirred in,
the tub is closely covered and kept in a warm
temperature till the coagulation is complete,
which is generally in little more than half an
hour.</p>

<p>As soon as the curd is well set, it is divided and
turned over with a bowl to separate it from the
whey; after which it is broken into small pieces
by the hand, and suffered to settle down, while
the whey, which swims at the top, is poured off.
The curd is pressed on one side of the tub with a
loose board, and the whey that runs from it is
again poured off. The curd is then drawn into
the centre of the tub, and formed into a heap,
and the board is laid on the top and heavy weights
placed on it, generally amounting to a hundred
pounds. This presses the curd into a solid mass,
and squeezes out an additional quantity of whey.</p>

<p>The mass of curd is then cut into slices, and
boards and weights put upon each slice. This is
repeated several times, till not a drop more whey
will run from the curd; after which it is removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
to a dry tub, and crumbled with the fingers as
small as possible. It is then well salted, and put
into a cheese-vat made warm by being scalded
with boiling water, and heaped up as high as it
will go, the additional curd being kept in its place
by a movable tin hoop. A flat board is then laid
across the top to press down the curd, which generally
rises to a point in the centre of the vat,
and the heavy weights are again put on it. At
the same time wooden skewers are run into the
cheese, in order that every particle of whey may
be drawn out of it.</p>

<p>After standing some time, the cheese is taken
out of the vat, and laid on a large cheese-cloth,
and the curd again broken from the top down the
centre, and more salt mixed with it; after which
it is pressed into the vat by the hand as before,
and weights are again put upon it, while skewers
are run through holes purposely left in the vat,
into the sides of the cheese, as before. Another
vat having been scalded by being rinsed with
boiling water, the cheese is wrapped in a cloth
and put into it; the ends of the cloth being folded
over the cheese as tightly as possible, and tucked
inside the vat, where they are kept down by a tin
hoop called a binder, which is forced in between
the cheese and the upper part of the vat. The
cheese is then put into the press under a pressure
of about a ton weight, and a number of thin iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
skewers are passed through the holes in the vat
into the sides of the cheese. After four hours it is
turned, and the skewers removed to fresh places,
when the cheese is put into the press for another
four hours; after which, the process is repeated.
It is then put into the press, and left there all
night; the following morning it is again turned,
and put into the press without the skewers. It
remains in the press for four or five days, being
regularly turned every morning and evening; and
it is taken from the press into the cheese-room,
where it is salted on the outside, and tightly
bound with a linen cloth. It is kept in this state
and turned twice a day for a week; after which it
is put on the shelves to dry for a fortnight or three
weeks, during which period it must be turned and
wiped every day. Lastly, it is then laid on straw,
and kept rather warm, lest the rind should crack;
and, when the rind begins to feel hard, its surface
is rubbed over with butter, and the cheese is
ready for the market. It is rather singular that,
notwithstanding the pains taken to drain every
drop of whey from the Cheshire cheese, its whey
yields no butter, and is seldom made any use of
except for feeding pigs.</p>

<p><i>Cheddar cheese</i> is made like Cheshire, except
that when the cheese is broken down to be resalted,
before it is put in the cheese-press, the
curd is crumbled, and four or five pounds of fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
butter are mixed with it. The cheese is then
put in a cloth into the vat, and placed under the
great press, where it remains only about a quarter
of an hour, before it is turned and put into a
clean cloth: this process is repeated three or four
times; after which the cheese is wrapped in a
very fine cloth, and has three or four other cloths
wrapped round it. It is then put into the press,
and remains there for forty-eight hours; after
which it is taken from the press, washed in whey,
and then laid on a shelf upon a clean cloth to dry.
It is afterwards laid on a shelf without any cloth,
and turned every day till it begins to ripen.</p>

<p>The <i>Wiltshire cheeses</i> are of four kinds: the
thin, the thick, the loaf cheese, and the pine-apple,
or net, cheese. The first two kinds are
made nearly the same as the Gloucester cheeses;
for which, indeed, they are frequently sold in the
London markets. The principal difference in the
manufacture consists in the curd, before it is
scalded, being cut into dice of about an inch
square each, and a thick layer of salt being thrown
over them, which is said to harden the surface of
the curd, and to prevent its buttery particles being
washed away by the hot water. The curd is also
put into the vat while it is as hot as the dairy-maid
can handle it; and salt is strewed in between
every layer. In all other respects, the manufacture
of the cheese is exactly the same as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Gloucestershire till it is ready to be carried to the
cheese-room, where it is either laid upon elder
leaves or the shelves are washed over with their
juice, in order to prevent the devastations of
mites. The loaf cheeses are made the same as the
others; but their vats are from ten inches to a foot
in diameter, and six inches deep; and, when the
curd is put into the vat, it is in four layers, with
alternate thin layers of salt. These are what are
generally sold in London as Wiltshire cheeses.
The curd for the pine-apple cheese is prepared in
the same way as the others; but, instead of being
put into a vat and then into the cheese-press, it is
put into a net with no other pressure than from
the hand of the dairy-maid; who, however, prides
herself on getting as much into the net as it can
possibly hold. The net is then hung up in the
cheese-room, and requires no further care.</p>

<p>I shall now give you only one more receipt for
making keeping-cheeses, and that shall be for the
far-famed <i>Parmesan</i>. This celebrated cheese is
made with skim-milk. The night's milking is
skimmed in the morning, and the morning's milk
is skimmed about two o'clock in the afternoon:
the two are then mixed together and put into a
large copper kettle, suspended over a fire by a
crane. The milk is stirred till it has reached
125° of Fahrenheit. The kettle is now turned
from the fire, between which and it a wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
screen is placed; and, when the bubbling of the
milk has subsided, a piece of rennet, tied in a
linen rag, is put into the milk, and squeezed
several times in different places. The rennet is
then taken out, and the milk well stirred; after
which it is left till the curd has formed, which is
generally in about three quarters of an hour. As
soon as this is the case the kettle is again turned
on the fire, and the mass of curd is heated to 150°,
being well stirred and divided while it is heating.
A fourth part of the whey is now taken out of
the kettle, and the curd is heated to 180°, stirring
it rapidly all the time; and a few pinches of
powdered saffron are thrown in, which not only
colour it, but give that peculiar flavour always
perceptible in Parmesan cheese. The cheese-maker
(for as Parmesan cheese is always made by
a man, I must not say the dairy-maid) then takes
a small quantity of the curd in his hand, and
squeezes it; when, if he finds it adhere together,
the kettle is instantly turned off the fire, the
wooden screen is again interposed, and the curd
is left to settle. The whey which rises is immediately
poured off, and two or three pailfuls of
cold water are thrown over the curd. The cheese-maker
immediately plunges his arms into the
kettle, and, gathering the curd to one side, contrives
to slip the whole mass into a large cloth,
which is raised as rapidly as possible, and transferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
to a mould without a bottom. This is an
operation which requires both strength and skill;
for the cheese hardens so rapidly, that it requires
the greatest exertions to get it into the mould
without spoiling its shape. By its own power of
contraction it presses out every drop of whey. An
iron plate, with a slight weight on it, is laid on
the top to keep it flat; but, by the time it is cold,
it is become so hard as to require no further
pressure. It is then taken out of the mould, and
a thick layer of salt put on its upper surface.
The next day the cheese is turned, and the under
surface salted in the same manner. In this way
the cheese is turned and salted every day for
thirty or forty days, till the salt will no longer
dissolve. The rind of the cheese is then scraped,
and, after a little colouring matter has been rubbed
over it, it is covered with linseed oil.</p>

<p>I will now say a few words on <i>Cream cheeses</i>,
and then, I think, you will have had quite enough
of this subject.</p>

<p>A <i>York cream cheese</i> is made by taking a quart
of new milk warm from the cow, into which is
sometimes put half a pint of cream, and adding
to it two spoonfuls of the water in which a piece
of rennet has been steeped all night. The milk
is then set before the fire till the curd is formed,
when it should be taken up without breaking, if
possible, and put into a frame made of oak wood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
seven inches long within, four inches wide, and
three inches and a half deep. This frame being
open at the top and bottom, it must be placed
upon rushes to permit the whey to run out; to
encourage which, a board must be put within the
frame to support a weight to press down the curd,
between which and the curd some rushes must be
put. After standing two days, the rushes must
be renewed, when the cheese should be taken from
the vat and turned as often as necessary. This
will make an excellent cream cheese without
the cream; and, indeed, the York cheeses sold in
the shops are always made of milk only, without
any cream. The rushes should be sewed together
with thread.</p>

<p>A kind of cream cheese is, however, made
in Yorkshire of cream only, without any rennet.
"Take any quantity of cream and put it into
a wet cloth. Tie it up, and hang it in a cool
place for seven or eight days. Then take it from
the cloth and put it into a mould (in another
cloth) with a weight upon it, for two or three
days longer. Turn it twice a day, when it will
be fit for use."</p>

<p>The following is a receipt for making a <i>Bath
cream cheese</i>. Add half a pint of cream to a
quart of new milk, and warm the mixture till
it is about 80° of Fahrenheit; then stir in as
much rennet as will coagulate it. As soon as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
curd has formed, put a cloth over the bottom of a
large shallow vat, and, taking the curd up with a
skimming-dish, place it in the vat and wrap the
cloth over it. As the curd shrinks, the vat must
be filled up with fresh curd, till the cheese is of a
proper thickness. When the cheese has become
a little firm, it is turned out of the vat and laid in
a dry cloth. A board is then put over it, on
which is placed a weight of two pounds. At
night it is put into another clean cloth, and the
next morning it is slightly salted with a little fine
dry salt, and placed on a bed of fresh nettles or
strawberry leaves, being covered with leaves of
the same kind. These leaves are changed every
morning, and the cheese is turned twice a day for
a fortnight, after which it is fit for use.</p>

<p>I think I have now told you almost all I know
relative to those points of domestic economy in
which a country life differs from a life in town. I
have, however, omitted to mention an <i>Ice-house</i>,
which you will find an important addition to your
comfort in summer. A common ice-house is a
kind of well, built in Roman cement, and sunk in
the ground. It is arched over, and the ice is put
in through a hole in the top. A door is on one
side for taking the ice out, and there is a drain at
the bottom for carrying away the water that runs
off as the ice melts.</p>

<p>A more modern invention is a small <i>cellar</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
built adjoining the house, with double walls, the
space between the walls being filled with charcoal.
The cellar has double doors with a space
between, so that one may be shut before the
other is opened, to prevent the entrance of the
atmospheric air. The ice is kept in a sunk
part made like a bath, at the farther end of the
cellar, furnished with a drain to carry off the
superfluous water; and in the other part of the
cellar are shelves, on which wine or food can be
placed to be kept cool. The old-fashioned ice-house
was always made in the park at some distance
from the house, and consequently was of
very little use; but the modern ice-cellar is very
useful for keeping cool, water, butter, and other
articles of daily consumption; which can be fetched
out of it when they are wanted, as easily and
expeditiously as they could be out of a common
dairy or pantry.</p>

<p>When ice is supplied from a distance, it will
soon melt, if exposed to the atmospheric air
during summer. To prevent this it may be kept
in an <i>ice chest</i>, that is, a large deep coffer lined with
cork, and with a double lid; or in a box called a
<i>refrigerator</i>, which may even be brought into
the dining-room. The refrigerator consists of a
double frame of wood, with the space between
filled in with charcoal. The bottles of wine are
placed in little tin cases left for them, and ice is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
put between the cases. Below the ice is a tin
grating, through which the melted water runs,
and is let off when requisite by a cock. The
box is made to hold two bottles of wine on one
side, and a bottle of water and a glass for butter
on the other.</p>

<p>The <i>American refrigerator</i> is another contrivance
of the same nature, which will keep the ice
unmelted for a fortnight even during the hottest
weather in summer. This box, like the other, is
double, the inner part being of lead, and the space
between the two being filled with sawdust.
There are two lids so as completely to exclude
the air when both are closed.</p>

<p><i>The usual mode of cooling wine and other
liquids by ice</i>, is to surround the bottle, or other
vessel in which the liquor is contained, entirely
with ice, observing that the hottest part of the
wine is always at the top of the bottle, but that if
the top is chilled faster than the bottom, the cold
wine descends, and that which is still warm rises
and takes its place. As, therefore, the wine is
liable to be set in motion by the process of cooling,
it is best to decant it before it is put into the refrigerator,
as otherwise there will be danger of
disturbing the sediment of white wine and the
crust of port. When ice is perfectly clean and
clear, like that of the Wenham Lake, it is sometimes
broken into small pieces, and put into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
liquid which is to be cooled; but this could not
be done with the ice collected from the dirty ponds
near London.</p>

<p>When it is wished to cool wine rapidly, it is
only necessary to put it into a thin glass bottle,
and to wet the outside with ether; as cold is produced
by rapid evaporation sooner than in any
other manner, wine-coolers are formed on this
principle.</p>

<p><i>A freezing mixture</i> for cooling wine, and for
freezing ice-creams, may be formed by mixing
five parts of sal ammoniac with five parts of nitre
and sixteen of water. A mixture of snow or
pounded ice and salt produces a most intense
cold, but it is only while the salt is melting the
ice or snow that the cold is felt. Muriate of
lime, mixed with snow, produces a still greater
degree of cold. Several other mixtures may be
used for freezing; but those producing the most
intense cold are mixtures of nearly equal parts
of sulphate of soda with nitrous or sulphuric
acid, the sulphate predominating. Eight parts of
sulphate of soda, mixed with five parts of muriatic
acid, will produce a cold equal to zero. When
any liquid is to be frozen by these mixtures, the
bottle containing the liquid is put into a wooden
vessel containing the mixture; and if the cold
is to be very intense, the outer vessel may be
placed on a flat piece of cork in a much larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
empty vessel, the whole being covered with a
woollen cloth. Water freezes soonest when it has
been boiled, and forms the most compact and
beautiful ice.</p>

<p><i>The principal utensils required</i> for making ice-creams
are a tub large enough to contain about
a bushel of ice, which must be pounded small,
and mixed with salt, nitre, or soda, and a freezing-pot
made of pewter, like those sent out with
ice-creams. Copper spoons or spaddles are also
required for stirring the ingredients of which
the ice-creams are composed, while the process
of freezing is going on. When all is ready, the
ingredients for the ice-creams are poured into
the freezing-pot, which is put up to its cover
into the tub full of ice and salt, and kept turning
round continually by its handle till the freezing
is completed. The turning the pot is the most
difficult part of the operation, and it requires
great attention, as, unless the ingredients are kept
in constant motion, the sugar, which is the heaviest,
will sink to the bottom, and the other articles will
be unequally frozen, so as to form unsightly
lumps. The cover must be taken off occasionally,
to see how the process is going on, and the cream
that has adhered to the sides of the freezing-pot
should be scraped off, and mixed with the rest by
the spaddle, in order to prevent waste. The
whole of the ingredients should also be mixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
together with the spaddle if they appear to be
settling irregularly.</p>

<p><i>Ice-creams</i> and water-ices should be perfectly
smooth, and soft enough to break easily with a
spoon. The ice-creams are made by mashing the
fruit with which they are to be flavoured, and
adding to a pint of the juice, after it has been
strained, a pint of thick cream, the juice of half a
lemon, and sugar to the taste. The lemon-juice
should be put in last. Sometimes whipped cream
is used, the cream being first mixed with sugar, and
laid on a fine sieve, turned the bottom upwards in
a bowl, as it is whipped, so that the cream which
drains from it may not be wasted. Water-ices are
generally only the juice of the fruit strained and
sweetened, as, if water is added, the ice is apt to
freeze too hard. Lemon-ice is composed of the
juice of four lemons, and the rind of one, to a pint
of clarified sugar-syrup, the whole being strained
before putting it into the freezing-pot.</p>

<p>It gives me great pain, my dear Annie, to find
that you still think that you shall never like the
country so well as town. I do not, however,
despair; for I am convinced that you do not at
present know whether you shall like it or not.
The pleasures of the town and the country are,
indeed, so different, that it requires some time to
become accustomed to the change; but, when you
are sufficiently well acquainted with country pursuits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
to take an interest in them, I am sure you
will never feel any want of the pleasures of the
town. The great secret of being happy is, to be
able to occupy ourselves with the objects around
us, so as to feel an interest in watching their
changes; and, when you can once do this in your
present situation, you will no longer complain of
dulness or want of excitement. To be convinced
of the truth of what I say, you need only remember
the pleasure your friend Mrs. P. C. takes in
the cultivation of her garden; the interest with
which she watches the opening of her flowers, the
coming up of the seeds she has sown, and the
growth of the trees she has planted. It is not
the positive beauty of these things that occasions
the pleasure she experiences in them, but the interest
they have created in her mind; for the
entomologist will find pleasure in the most hideous
caterpillars, and the geologist will pass whole days
delightfully among barren rocks. All that is
wanted to give an interest in any subject is, a
sufficient degree of knowledge respecting it to be
aware of its changes, and our own natural love of
variety will do the rest.</p>

<p>It is a great advantage in a country life, that
its principal objects of interest must be found at
home; and hence, as home is woman's peculiar
dominion, the noblest and the best feelings of the
female heart are more likely to be called into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
action in the country than in the town. In
youth, especially, the ameliorating effects of
country pursuits will soon be perceptible, both
morally and physically; and your health, which
has always been delicate in a town, will, I have
no doubt, in the country become positively robust.
As the first step towards the attainment of this
desirable object, let me recommend to you to
have a flower-garden laid out as near the house as
possible. I should like to have those cedars, and the
remainder of those gloomy firs, cleared away, which
I see close to your house in your sketches, and
your flower-garden so placed that you could step
into it at once from the windows of your usual sitting-room.
I hope that this may soon be the case,
and, as I must have a <i>locale</i> to make my descriptions
understood, I will proceed to give you some
hints as to the laying out and planting of such a
garden as I should like you to have in the warm
and sheltered corner under the southern window
of your morning room.</p>

<p>In the first place, it will be absolutely necessary
that the remainder of the trees should be not only
cut down, but grubbed up; as it will be quite
impossible for any flowers to grow under the
shade of tall thick trees, and leaving the roots
would prevent the possibility of digging the
ground. In other respects the situation is admirably
adapted for the purpose, as it is open to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the south and south-east, and protected from the
north and north-west. Supposing the Scotch
pines and cedars to have been cut down, their
roots to have been grubbed up, and the ground to
have been dug over and levelled, the next thing
is to determine upon the plan for the garden. I
think it should certainly be a regular geometric
figure, and planted in masses, each bed containing
flowers of one kind, so as to produce something
of the effect of a Turkey carpet when looked
down upon from the windows of the house. I
enclose you a design which I think will suit the
situation, and I will adapt what I have to say to
it, though my observations may easily be made
suitable to another plan, if another should be found
more desirable.</p>

<p>We will suppose the plan (fig. 7.) to consist of
twelve flower-beds on grass, with a gravel walk
round, which may be bordered on the side next
your room by beds for flowers, with little gravel
openings opposite each of your windows; or be
plain gravel, as you like. There may be a conservatory
into which the drawingroom windows
facing the south may open, and on the other side
a shrubbery to unite the garden with the lawn.
In the centre of the flower-garden there may be
a fountain; and, as the flower-garden is to be
seen principally from your windows, the beds
nearest you should be planted with dwarf flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
so that those in the back beds may be seen. I
should also advise the shrubbery behind to consist
of laurustinus and arbutus, so as to furnish a handsome
green back-ground to the flowers in summer,
and yet to afford a few flowers themselves in
winter and spring, when flowers are scarce in the

</div>

<p>I will now tell you how I would plant the
beds. As this is the beginning of May, and as
I wish your garden to look well immediately, I
would advise you to get a few pots of Californian
and other annuals, usually raised in pots,
from the nurseryman at the neighbouring town,
and to plant them, putting three potfuls in each bed,
but no more. In No. 1. put Phlóx Drummóndi,
the flowers of which are crimson of various shades,
and let the stems be pegged down, so as to spread
over the bed. No. 2. may be Lasthènia califórnica,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the flowers of which are yellow, and the
stems generally procumbent; but they may be
pegged down to keep them in their proper places,
that is, to spread completely and regularly over
the bed. No. 3. should be Nemóphila insígnis,
the flowers of which are of a beautiful blue,
and which will not require pegging down. No. 4.
may be Erýsimum Perofskiànum, the flowers of
which are of a bright orange, but the stems must be
pegged down, or they will grow tall and straggling.
No. 5. may be Nolàna atriplicifòlia, the flowers of
which are blue, and resemble those of a convolvulus;
this is a procumbent plant, and will not
require pegging. No. 6. may be Nemóphila atomària,
which has white flowers, and is a dwarf
plant. No. 7. may be Leptosìphon densiflòrus, a
dwarf plant, with pale purple flowers. No. 8.
may be Gília bícolor, a dwarf plant, with nearly
white flowers. No. 9. may be Clintònia pulchélla,
a beautiful little plant with blue flowers. No. 10.
may be Gília trícolor, a dwarf plant, the flowers
of which are white and very dark purple. No. 11.
may be Leptosìphon androsàceus, a dwarf plant,
with pale lilac flowers: and No. 12. Schizopétalon
Wálkeri, the flowers of which are white, and the
stems must be pegged down. These are all annuals,
which if properly treated by pegging down,
and not planted too close, will produce a mass of
flowers in each bed only just above the surface,
and will have a very pretty effect from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
windows. Most of them like a poor clayey soil
best, and they will only require turning out of
the pots without breaking the ball, into the places
prepared for them.</p>

<p>If you think there are too many white beds,
you can substitute Sanvitàlia procúmbens, the
flowers of which are yellow, for No. 8., but the
seeds must have been sown the previous autumn
to bring it forward, as otherwise it will not flower
till late in the summer; and Bartònia aúrea, the
flowers of which are of a golden yellow, may be
planted instead of No. 12. Cladánthus arábicus,
formerly called Ànthemis arábica, which has yellow
flowers, may be planted in No. 8., if Sanvitàlia
cannot be obtained.</p>

<p>I do not think you have ever told me what soil
yours is, and perhaps you hardly know. You will,
however, easily recognise gravel or chalk; if the
soil be red, it is probably, if loose, a sand, and if
close, a marl; a peaty soil is black and loose; and
a clay may be known by water standing in little
pools after rain, without running off. This is one
of the worst soils for gardening purposes; but it
may be improved by mixing it with sand.</p>

<p>I shall now give you a list of half-hardy plants
for autumn, as most of the annuals will begin to
look shabby in July or the beginning of August.
No. 1. Verbèna Melíndres, bright scarlet; No. 2.
Œnothèra Drummóndi, yellow; No. 3. Lobèlia
bícolor, blue; No. 4. Calceolària rugòsa, pegged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
down; No. 5. Verbèna Tweediàna, crimson; No. 6.
common White Petunia; No. 7. Verbèna Arraniàna,
or Henderson's purple; No. 8. Calceolària integrifòlia,
yellow; No. 9. Purple Petunia; No. 10.
Verbèna teucrioìdes, white; No. 11. Frogmore
Pelargonium, bright scarlet; No. 12. Musk plant,
yellow.</p>

<p>In October the following bulbs and other plants
may be put in for flowering in early spring.
No. 1. Von Thol Tulips; No. 2. Cloth of Gold,
or common Yellow Crocuses; No. 3. Blue Hepatica;
No. 4. Yellow Crocuses, or White Anemone;
No. 5. Scílla vérna and sibírica, blue; No. 6.
Àrabis álbida, white; No. 7. Double Pink Hepatica;
No. 8. Winter Aconite; No. 9. Purple Crocuses;
No. 10. Snowdrops; No. 11. Primroses;
No. 12. White Hepatica, or Àrabis alpìna.</p>

<p>If you do not like the plan for a garden which I
have sent you, you can draw one according to
your own fancy, of any figure you like; but, as I
believe you have not yet a regular gardener, it
will be necessary to teach you how to transfer the
plan you have decided upon from the paper to the
ground. In the first place, the ground must be
dug over, raked, and made perfectly smooth. The pattern,
if a complicated one, must then be
drawn on Berlin paper, which is covered with
regular squares, and the ground to be laid out
must be covered with similar squares, but larger;
the usual proportion being that a square inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
on the paper represents a square foot on the
ground. The squares on the ground are usually
formed by sticking in wooden pegs at regular
distances, and fastening strings, from peg to
peg, till the whole ground is covered with a kind
of latticework of string. Each string is then
chalked, and made to thrill by pulling it up
sharply and letting it go again, which transfers the
chalk from the string to the ground. When the
ground is thus covered with white squares, it is
easy to trace upon it, with a sharp-pointed stick,
any pattern which may have been drawn on the
paper; the portion in each square on the ground
being copied on a larger scale from that of the
corresponding square on the paper.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 8. <i>Plan for a Flower-Garden.</i></div>
</div>

<p>Simple patterns (fig. 8.), consisting of straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
lines, need only to be measured, and pieces of string
stretched from pegs put in at the proper distances,
so as to form straight lines, oblongs, squares, triangles,
or diamonds. If a circle is to be traced, it
is done by getting a piece of string half the length
of the diameter of the circle, with a piece of stick
tied to each end. One stick is then driven into
the ground in the centre of the circle, and a line is
traced with a stick at the other extremity of the
string which is drawn out quite tight. An oval
is made by tracing two circles, the circumscribing
line of one of which just touches the centre of the
other; short lines are afterwards made at the top
and bottom, and the central lines are obliterated. A
square only requires a peg at each corner, with a
chalked string drawn from peg to peg; and an
oblong, or parallelogram, is made by joining two
common squares, and taking off the corners if required.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 181px;">
<img src="images/fig_09.jpg" width="181" height="143" alt="wood engraving" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 9.</div>
</div>

<p>A heart-shaped pattern (fig. 9.) is made by
drawing a straight line from
<i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, and then fixing a peg
with a string tied to it, half
the length of the straight line,
and another peg at the end,
exactly in the middle of the
line, and drawing a half-circle
with it; then taking a peg with a string half
the length of the other, and another peg tied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
to the end, and tracing with it the smaller half-circles,
<i>c</i> and <i>d</i>. With the same strings and pegs
you may easily trace, or rather have traced, figs.
10 and 11. Even the latter, which appears at first
sight a very difficult figure to form on the ground,
will be just as easily traced as the others. You
will observe, that in all these figures the straight
line is only to serve as a guide to show the proper
places for fixing the pegs; and that it is only to be
formed by a piece of string stretched by pegs from
one end of the figure to the other, which is to be
removed as soon as the figure is sketched, and
which is not to be traced on the ground at all.</p>

</div>

<p>With the aid of these figures, and the pegs and
strings, several very complicated gardens may
be formed; for instance, that shown in fig. 12.
This garden is composed of a bed in the centre
for a tree rose with a circle of dwarf roses;
a gravel walk surrounds these; and there are
five heart-shaped beds, which may be planted with
Scarlet Pelargoniums, yellow Calceolarias, Petunias
white and purple, and tall yellow Mimulus;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
and the crescent-shaped beds, which are on grass,
may all be planted with different kinds of Verbenas.
This plan is also a good design for a rosery,
the roses to be planted in the beds, and in the
half crescents which must be on grass, with gravel
walks between the grass plots.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 393px;">
<img src="images/fig_12.jpg" width="393" height="396" alt="wood engraving" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 12. <i>Plan for a Flower-Garden.</i></div>
</div>

<p>All the beds intended for bulbs and half-hardy
plants should be particularly well drained; and the
best way of doing this is, to dig out the soil to
the depth of two feet or more, and then to put in a
layer of brick-bats and other rubbish, to the depth
of nine inches or a foot. On this should be placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
a layer of rich marly soil, in which the bulbs
should be planted. Dahlias, hollyhocks, and other
tall-growing, showy-flowered plants, may have
similar beds prepared for them, but the soil should
be made very rich by the addition of the remains
of an old hotbed, or some other kind of half-rotten
animal manure.</p>

<p>You will observe, that when I give directions for
planting the beds in any of the plans I send you, I
merely say what may be done, and not what is absolutely
necessary. Indeed, it will be better for
you to vary the flowers as much as possible, according
to your own taste, provided you take care that
the plants are, as nearly as you can contrive it,
of the same height, or that they rise gradually,
and that you contrast the colours well. The rule
in the latter case is, always to put one of the primitive
colours (red, blue, or yellow) next another
of these colours, or some colour compounded of
the other two; using white wherever you cannot
find any handsome plants of a colour that will
suit the bed you want them for. Thus, for example,
if you plant one bed with red, you may
plant the next with blue, yellow, green, hair-brown,
or white, but never with any shade of
purple, as red enters into the composition of that
colour; nor with any shade of reddish brown:
purple, indeed, must always be next yellow,
hair-brown, or white, but never next blue, red-brown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
or red. Orange will not look well near
yellow or red; and lilac must not approach blue
or pink. A little practice will do more than any
lengthened details; generally speaking, you may
take the same taste to guide you in arranging the
colours of the flowers in your parterre, that you
use in choosing the colours of your dresses; and
if you are in any doubt, you have only to colour
the beds in the plan, and see how they look; or
to stick coloured wafers on a piece of paper for
the same purpose.</p>

<p>When you have settled what to plant in the
beds of your garden, supposing you to choose the
plan fig. 7., you must next think of the beds
round it. I should advise these to remain unplanted,
unless they are sown with mignonette,
or something of that kind. The shrubberies, I
have already stated, should, I think, consist chiefly
of the finer kinds of hardy evergreens; at least
that should which is opposite the windows of your
sitting-room. The other shrubbery, which is intended
to unite the garden scenery with that of
the park, may be planted with rhododendrons,
acacias, and kalmias; the rhododendrons being
farthest from the walk, and carried a little out
into the park, so as to make a broken line, projecting
in some places and receding in others,
and here and there mixed with bushes of phillyrea,
alaternus, holly of various kinds, and cratægus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
so as gradually to mingle with the clumps
of trees in the park. On the side next your room,
if there are to be beds under the windows, there
should be spaces left in them which should be gravelled
so that you may throw the window open,
and not only walk out on gravel, but walk round
the garden on gravel also. This you will find a
great convenience if the weather should be wet,
though you must not mind going upon the grass,
if you are to be a real gardener, and to attend to
the flowers in the regular beds. With regard to
the beds near the house, I would have a Lonícera
flexuòsa trained over each window, on account of
its delightful fragrance in summer; for a similar
reason I would have Chimonánthus fràgrans against
the walls between the windows, and mignonette
and violets in the beds.</p>

<p>I think nothing can be more delightful than to
throw open your window, and to inhale a refreshing
odour from growing flowers when they
are swept over by a balmy breeze, particularly
after a slight shower; and, for this purpose, I
would strongly recommend you to plant flowers
near your windows which have a refreshing, but
not a heavy, scent. The flowers of the evergreen
magnolia, and those of the orange, have an oppressive
fragrance, as have those of the heliotrope
and the tuberose; but those of the mignonette,
the lemon-scented verbena, the rose, the violet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and Lonícera flexuòsa are refreshing, at the same
time that they yield a delicious perfume.</p>

<p>I must now give you some hints on cultivating
your flowers. To begin with the <i>bulbs</i>, as they
flower first in spring. The crocuses and snowdrops
should be planted, five or six together, as close as
possible, so as to form little tufts; and these,
when once planted, should never be removed,
unless they should grow out of bounds, so as to
spoil the shape of the bed. The tulips, on the
contrary, should be taken up as soon as their
leaves begin to decay, and kept in a dry place till
the proper time for planting them next year.</p>

<p>You must observe that there are three kinds of
plants which are said to have bulbous roots: those
which are solid, and which should be properly called
corms, such as the crocus, the corn-flag, and many
of the half-hardy plants with similar half-tubular
flowers; the tunicated bulbs, which consist of a
number of distinct layers, called tunics, that may
be peeled off, such as the onion, the hyacinth, and
the tulip; and the scaly bulbs such as the lily. Now
the real roots of all these plants are the long fibres
sent down by the lower part of the bulb, which
may be seen plainly in hyacinths grown in glasses,
and in any of the kinds if taken up while in a
growing state; and what is called the bulb is, in
all the corms, only a contracted stem; but, in the
tunicated and scaly bulbs, the bulbous part is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
formed of a contracted stem and metamorphosed
leaves. If you will take the trouble to examine
a hyacinth, you will find at the base of the bulb a
flat fleshy substance, called the root-plate, and
this is, in fact, the contracted stem of the plant;
while the tunics are metamorphosed leaves. In
the scaly bulbs the stem is plainly perceptible in
the centre, and the scales are evidently metamorphosed
leaves. You will easily remember
these distinctions, and you will find it useful to
attend to them in cultivating your garden, as all
plants having corms never flower well till they
have been allowed to form a mass, which they will
not do till they have been in the ground three or
four years.</p>

<p>Many persons fancy that the Cape bulbs require
to be taken up every year, but this is
altogether a mistake: all the kinds of gladiolus,
ixia, tritonia, and other similar plants, will live in
the open ground, and flower well, if suffered to
grow in masses, which would be killed by a single
English winter if planted separately. The finest
bed of the scarlet gladiolus I ever saw was at
Blair-Adam, near Stirling, where it was suffered
to remain year after year without alteration; and
the Honourable and Reverend William Herbert,
now Dean of Manchester, in his celebrated work
on the Amaryllidàceæ, states that he has had
beds of gladiolus, ixia, tritonia, and other Cape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
bulbs, at Spofforth in Yorkshire, which have remained
for several years, without protection, in
the open ground. Some persons say that, by
manuring the beds every year, tulips and hyacinths
may also be grown in the same beds without
taking up, for several years in succession; but
this I have never seen tried.</p>

<p>You must observe that you have no chance of
keeping your flower-garden in a proper state,
unless you have in some retired place what is
called a <i>reserve-garden</i>, in which the plants may
be brought forward till they are in a proper state
for transplanting into the proper flower-garden.
This reserve-garden is generally placed near the
stable, both to have it out of sight, and for the
convenience of manure; as it must contain hotbeds
and frames, for rearing tender annuals, striking
cuttings, and, in short, for performing all those
gardening operations which require to be carried
on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>In this reserve-garden you must bring forward
your <i>Californian annuals</i>; and for this purpose
choose a piece of hard ground, a walk will do, or
any place that has been much trodden on, and
cover it about an inch thick with light rich soil.
In this the seeds of the annuals should be sown
the first week in September, and suffered to remain
till the bulbs have faded, and the annuals
are wanted to cover the beds, which will probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
be about April. The annuals must then be taken
up with the spade, in patches, and being removed
to the flower-garden, they must be laid carefully
on the beds, so as to cover them exactly; the
spaces between the patches being filled with soil,
and pressed gently down, so that the surface of
the beds may be as even as possible. These
annuals will come into blossom in May, but they
are killed by the dry heat of summer; and, though
they would sow themselves if permitted to seed, it
is better to remove them as soon as they have
done flowering. It is always a bad plan to permit
annuals to sow themselves; as early in autumn,
when the plants have done flowering, the ground
not only becomes rough, but it is covered with
dead stalks and leaves, which have always a most
miserable and desolate appearance; and these
cannot be removed till the seed has fallen, while
the beds must not be forked over and raked for
fear of destroying the seedlings. It is therefore
much better, as soon as the annuals have done
flowering, to take them up, and throw them away;
a supply of seed being preserved by having left
some plants in the reserve-ground for that purpose.
A second or spring sowing of the Californian
annuals may be made in the reserve-ground, to be
ready for use in case any should be wanted to
flower in the autumn.</p>

<p>Though I have only advised you to have Californian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
annuals in your beds, I may here say a
few words on the culture of <i>annuals</i> generally.
You are, of course, aware that what are called annuals
are plants that live only one year, or, rather,
only a few months; for they are generally sown
early in spring, and die as soon as they have
ripened their seeds, at the latter end of summer,
or the beginning of autumn. These plants are of
three kinds; viz., hardy, half-hardy, and tender.</p>

<p>The <i>hardy annuals</i> are sown in March, April, or
May; but the first month is to be preferred, if the
weather is tolerably open. The ground in which
they are to be sown is first forked over and raked,
and a little round firm place having been made by
pressing the bottom of the saucer of a flower-pot
on the ground, a few seeds are scattered over it,
taking great care that the seeds do not lie one
upon another. The seeds are then firmed, as the
gardeners call it, by pressing the saucer again
upon them, and some earth is strewed lightly
over to finish the operation. You will observe,
that, though I have recommended you to take
the saucer of a flower-pot to firm the ground,
both before and after sowing your seeds, regular
gardeners perform this part of the operation with
their spades, and farmers roll their land before
they sow their seeds. The principle, however, is
the same in all; and it is that every seed requires
to be securely fixed in the ground before it begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
to germinate, in order to produce a strong and
healthy plant. After the seeds are sown, it is
customary to put a piece of stick into the ground,
with the name of the seeds written upon it, to
mark the place; or, if you like it better, you
can write the name on a card, or a bit of pasteboard,
and stick it in a notch or cleft cut in the
stick.</p>

<p>When the seeds have come up, which, in the
spring, is generally from a fortnight to six weeks
after sowing, according to their nature, the seedlings
may be thinned out, and the supernumerary
plants either transplanted or thrown away. If
the seedlings are to be transplanted, care should
be taken not to break or injure the roots, and a
little hole should be made with a stick for each
seedling in the place to which it is to be removed;
the earth being pressed close to the root at the
bottom of the hole before the rest is filled in; as,
if any hollow place is left round the root, it is
sure to decay instead of growing. Seedling hardy
annuals are, however, very seldom worth the trouble
of transplanting. Many persons turn a flower-pot
over every patch of seeds, from the idea that
it will make them come up sooner, and protect
them from the birds. It is, however, a very bad
plan, as air and light are particularly necessary
to seedling plants; and when they are even partially
deprived of these important agents, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
become drawn up with weak slender stems, and
thin discoloured leaves.</p>

<p>Some annuals, such as the mignonette and the
larkspur, are much longer before they vegetate
than others; and these are better sown in autumn.
Others, such as the escholtzia, the coreopsis,
and the Erýsimum Perowskiànum, will often last
two or three years, especially if they happen to
be late in flowering the first season. They also do
best sown in autumn, but they must be protected,
if the winter should be very severe, by laying a
mat over the bed. You must observe, however,
that the mat must only be resorted to in frosty
weather, as, in case the weather should be at all
damp, the plants will be much better exposed to
it, however cold it may feel, than they would be
under any protection whatever.</p>

<p>The <i>half-hardy annuals</i>, such as the French
and African marigolds, the German and China
asters, the zinnias, the purple jacobæa, the sweet
sultan, the purple and yellow everlastings, and
other similar plants, should be sown in pots, and
plunged into a slight hotbed in February or
March. As soon as they come up, and have got
their second pair of leaves, the earth should be
turned out of the pot, and the seedlings being
carefully picked out should be transplanted into
other pots, three or five in each, according to the
size they are expected to attain when full grown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
and the pots again plunged into the hotbed.
Sometimes they are transplanted a second time,
but they are generally left till the beginning of
May, when they are removed to the open border,
to the places where they are intended to flower.
When they are planted in the border, they may
either be transplanted in the ordinary way, or the
ball of earth may be turned entire from the pot
into a hole made to receive it. This last plan is
generally considered the best, as it prevents the
plants from receiving any check by their removal.
Brompton ten-week, and German stocks, though
quite hardy, make better plants when treated like
half-hardy annuals, as they flower earlier and
much more vigorously.</p>

<p><i>Tender annuals</i>, such as balsams, cock's-combs,
globe amaranths, &amp;c., must be sown in February
or March in pots of light rich earth, and plunged
in a hotbed. As soon as the plants come up
they should be transplanted into pots of the very
smallest size, one in each pot; and these small
pots should be set in the hotbed again, as near the
glass as possible, and slightly shaded during sunshine.
In a week or two, as soon as the roots
have made their appearance on the outside of the
ball of earth within the pot, which is known by
turning the ball of earth with the plant in it carefully
out of the pot without breaking it, the plants
are shifted into pots a size larger than what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
were in before, and the space filled up with light
rich soil. In another week or two the plants
must be shifted again into pots a little larger,
always using light rich mould to fill up the pots,
and taking care that the pots are well drained, by
putting potsherds, that is, pieces of broken pot at
the bottom. As soon as the plants are shifted,
the pots must be replunged in the hotbed, and
shaded for the remainder of the day. The shifting
and replunging must be continued till the plants
begin to show flower-buds; after which they must
neither be shifted nor plunged in the hotbed any
more, but gradually hardened, by the frame in
which they are placed being left open all day,
and, at last, only partially closed, even at night,
till the plants will bear setting out entirely in the
open air; unless they should be intended to flower
in a greenhouse, in which case they may be removed
to the greenhouse as soon as they have
formed flower-buds.</p>

<p>As I shall treat of the management of the
greenhouse plants, which are to succeed the annuals,
in my next, I may as well fill up my
present letter by saying a few words on the
management of hardy perennials, in case you
should prefer planting biennials and perennials in
your beds at once, to going through the routine
that I have marked out for you in the former part
of this letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Perennials</i> are those permanent plants which
are not woody, and yet remain in the ground as
long as most kinds of shrubs, producing flowers
and seeds every year. Perennials are of two kinds:
those that die down to the ground every autumn,
and send up fresh stems from the root the following
spring; and those which remain green all
the year, as, for example, the pinks and carnations.
Besides these kinds, there are other sorts of
perennials, as, for example, those that have tuberous
roots, such as the dahlia. Bulbs are also
perennials; but of these I have already spoken.</p>

<p>Most kinds of perennials are propagated by
dividing the roots; but, in the case of the dahlia,
ranunculus, and anemone, care must be taken to
choose only those portions of the tubers that have
buds or eyes, as they are called, as otherwise the
tuber, though it will send out fibrous roots, will
never produce a stem; and, in dividing fibrous-rooted
plants, care must be taken that the divided
part is furnished with buds. Almost all kinds of
perennials may also be propagated by cuttings;
and those of pinks and carnations are called pipings,
because, instead of being cut, they are
pulled asunder at a joint, and this gives the separated
parts a hollow appearance like small pipes.
Tubers are frequently taken up every autumn;
and those of the ranunculus and anemone are
replanted in November or January, the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
season being much to be preferred. The tubers
of the dahlia are generally taken up in November,
and replanted in May or June.</p>

<p>Most perennials are improved by taking them
up occasionally and replanting them in another
place. This used to be accounted for by supposing
that plants threw out excrementitious
matter, which, after a few years, poisoned the soil
in which they grew; but it is now supposed that,
as every plant requires peculiar earths for its
nourishment, they must be removed when they
have exhausted all the particular kind of earth
they want which lies within their reach. It is
rather difficult to explain this without entering
into long details; but it will be sufficient for our
present purpose merely to state the fact, that
plants do require their roots to have a constant
supply of fresh earth; and, to meet this want,
nature has provided that the roots of trees, and of
all plants that are intended to remain for several
years in the soil, elongate themselves every year,
so as to be continually able to obtain a fresh
supply of nourishment. In gardens, however, the
constant digging that is going on for the culture
of annual plants is unfavourable to the elongation
of the roots of the perennials, and consequently it
is absolutely necessary that those plants should
occasionally be taken up and replanted. The
season for taking up and replanting perennial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
plants is either in autumn, after they have done
growing, or in spring, before they begin to shoot;
and, if the soil about the roots looks black and
wet, or, as the gardeners express it, sour, the roots
should be washed quite clean before replanting.
When the roots of plants are divided, it is either
done with a sharp spade or a knife, care being taken
in both cases to make what is called a clean cut,
and not to leave any part bruised or jagged.</p>

<p><i>Biennials</i> are plants raised from seeds, which
do not flower till the second year, but which
generally die as soon as they have ripened their
seeds. Biennials are usually sown in a bed of
light rich earth in the open air in the reserve-ground,
and then transplanted in September to
the place where they are to flower the ensuing
year. The finer kinds, such as the Brompton
stocks and hollyhocks, should have a bed or
pit prepared for them, of rich loamy soil, in which
they are planted, with a small quantity of manure.
Wallflowers, snapdragons, and Canterbury
bells do not require any further care than transplanting
to the border; and, though they are
called biennials, they will frequently live and
flower three or four successive years.</p>

<p>A <i>hotbed</i> may be made of any material that
will ferment, so as to produce heat. Stable manure
and dead leaves are, however, generally preferred
to all other materials; and stable manure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
is unquestionably the best. A cart-load of this
manure will make a hotbed sufficiently large for
rearing tender annuals; but as, when it is taken
out of the stable, it consists partly of the dung of
the horse, and partly of what is called long litter,
that is, straw moistened and discoloured, but not
decayed, it must first be thrown together, so as
to form a heap till the straw is decomposed. A
most violent heat is produced by the fermentation
of the straw while decomposing; and, as this heat
would be too much for any plant exposed to it, it
is absolutely necessary to let the heap remain for
about a fortnight, turning it over two or three
times during that period with a fork, till the
straw is sufficiently decomposed to be easily torn
to pieces with the dung fork. When the manure
is in this state it is fit for use. The hotbed should
be formed in an open situation, on a surface raised
about six inches from the surrounding ground,
with a gutter or shallow ditch cut round it, to
allow the water to drain off. The bed is then
made; and, if only intended for raising annuals
and striking cuttings, it may be five feet long by
four feet wide. The manure should be first regularly
spread over the lower part of the bed, and
then continued, in successive layers, made as
smooth and level as possible, till the whole of the
cart-load of manure has been used.</p>

<p>As soon as the bed is finished the frame should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
be set on it. The frame consists of a box without
a bottom, and with a movable top, formed of a
glazed sash or sashes. A frame for a bed of the
size I have mentioned will only require one sash,
or light as the gardeners call it; and it should
be three feet wide and four feet long, so that
the bed may be half a foot larger than the frame
on every side. The back of the box may be
two feet high, and the front one foot, so that
the glass may slope from the back to the front.
About two days after the bed is made, the fermentation
will recommence, and a steam will be
observable on the glass. The surface of the bed
should now be covered two or three inches thick
with light garden mould, and any common seeds
may be sown in this. It is more general, however,
to sow the seeds in pots, and then either to
set them on the surface of the bed, or to plunge
them into it up to the rim. No bed for raising
annuals should ever be hotter than 60°, and when
it exceeds this heat the glasses should be left open
so as to cool it. The thermometer for ascertaining
the heat should be put on the surface of the bed,
with the glass shut above it; and it should be
examined in this situation, as it will fall a degree
or two immediately on being taken into the open
air, if the weather should be very cold.</p>

<p>You will, of course, have your hotbed made in
the reserve-ground; and, as the one I have given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
directions for will be a very small one, you will
probably find it necessary to have one much
larger for your cuttings, or to have three or four
small ones. I should advise the latter course, as
small hotbeds are much more easily managed by
inexperienced gardeners than large ones. A hotbed
of two or three lights will require two or
three cart-loads of manure, and will, of course,
produce a great deal of heat from the immense
mass of fermenting materials it contains; and,
as you would find this additional quantity of heat
very difficult to regulate, you might chance, some
fine morning, when you visited your plants, to
see them turned black, with their leaves shrivelled
up, or, as the gardeners term it, burnt, from the
too great heat of the bed. There is also danger
of a hotbed getting too cold instead of being too
hot, and, when this is the case, the heat should be
renewed by the application of dung linings, that
is, a quantity of fresh stable manure, round the
outside of the bed; or by having linings of dead
leaves piled up round the outside of the bed. If,
however, you use your hotbeds only for raising
seeds, they will not want any linings; as it will
be advantageous for the young seedlings to let the
beds gradually become cool as the plants increase
in size, so that they may acquire strength and
hardiness before they are turned into the open
ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>I will now say a few words on the <i>greenhouse
plants</i> that you will want for planting in the open
ground in your flower-garden. Petunias may be
all raised from seeds with the other half-hardy
annuals; as seedling plants both grow and flower
much more vigorously when planted out into the
open ground, than plants that have been raised
from layers or cuttings. Célsia or Alonsòa urticifòlia
may also be raised from seeds; as may
Thunbérgia alàta, and its white variety. Phlóx
Drummóndi is almost always raised in this manner;
as are the beautiful climbing plants, Lophospérmum
scándens and its varieties, Maurándya
Barclayàna, Cobœa scándens, Eccremocárpus or
Calámpelis scàbra, Rhodochìton volùbile, the beautiful
canary-bird flower (<i>Tropœ'olum peregrìnum</i>),
the most splendid of the ipomœas, and several
other well-known plants.</p>

<p>Geraniums, or pelargoniums, as they are now
more properly called, being half-shrubby plants,
require to be raised by cuttings. These are
generally taken off the points of the shoots in
autumn; and, a good many being put into one
pot, they are plunged into the hotbed till they
have struck root, and then gradually hardened
and placed on the back shelf of a greenhouse, or
in a cold frame, till the spring, when they are
removed to separate pots till they are wanted for
planting out. Some gardeners do not put themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
to the trouble of potting them, but keep
them in the same pots in which the cuttings were
struck till they are wanted for planting out; but
this is a slovenly mode of culture, as, when the
plants are kept so long in one pot, they become
drawn up, and never have the compact bushy
appearance that they have when they are properly
transplanted early in spring. Verbenas may be
either preserved by cuttings or layers, or raised
afresh from seed. The usual way of propagating
them, however, is by layers, as they strike root
readily at the joints, if the joints are covered with
a little earth. All the other greenhouse plants
which you may want to grow for planting out
may be treated in the same manner as those I
have mentioned.</p>

<p>A <i>cold frame</i> is a bottomless box of the kind
described for a hotbed, but formed of brick or
stone instead of wood. These frames have a glass
sash at the top, but contain no manure; and they
are generally sunk in the soil, that the warmth of
the earth around may aid in protecting the plants
they contain from the frost. These frames, if
they have only one light, are generally five feet
in width; that is, from the back to the front;
but, if they have two or three lights, the width is
generally seven feet, as these are the dimensions
of the frames used for hotbeds in kitchen-gardens.
The greenhouse plants that are to be preserved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the cold frame are merely set in their pots close
together, and, the glass sashes being then closed,
mats and other coverings are laid on to keep out
the frost.</p>

<p>Sometimes greenhouse plants which are left in
the open ground are preserved from the frost by
coverings of wicker-work like beehives being put
over them, or tin hoops over which mats have
been stretched; or, where the plants are small, a
flower-pot may be turned over them, or a hand-glass
used for the same purpose. It is seldom,
however, worth while to take much pains to preserve
greenhouse plants that have flowered in the
open air. The ordinary way is to make abundance
of cuttings in autumn; to strike them in a
hotbed, and then, after hardening them by degrees,
to preserve them in a small greenhouse, or
in a cold pit, till the time for planting out next
year.</p>

<p>Before I say any thing of the management of
the plants in your greenhouse, I must remind you
that, in order to grow plants well, it is not enough
merely to preserve them from the frost, but we
must imitate as well as we can their native climate:
that is, the degree of heat, light, and
moisture they have been accustomed to in their
native country, together with the air and the soil.
The latter is the easiest condition to fulfil; as, by
combining different kinds of earth, we can, without
much difficulty, produce a very tolerable imitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
of any soil we please: but it is not so easy
to give plants abundance of light and air in combination
with heat; and, though we can readily
give plants plenty of water, it requires some
management to surround them with a moist warm
atmosphere, like that they have been used to in
their native woods. To meet these difficulties,
buildings have been constructed, suited for the
reception of plants, with various contrivances for
producing heat and distributing air and moisture,
and with a glass roof, front, and sides, to admit
abundance of light.</p>

<p>These structures are what we call plant-houses;
and they are not only divided into hothouses for
tender plants, and greenhouses for half-hardy
plants, but subdivided into various kinds to suit
the various climates in which plants are found.
These climates, however, are not so numerous as
might at first be supposed; as it is a curious fact
in the history of plants, that many of the most
ornamental grow in patches in some parts of the
world without being found anywhere else, as, for
example, the pelargoniums or shrubby geraniums
at the Cape of Good Hope. Even when the
same plant is found in different parts of the world,
it is generally in the same climate, though in
different countries; and thus pines and firs, oaks
and birches, spread like belts or zones round the
globe, from Asia, through Europe, to America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
almost in the same degree of latitude, making an
allowance for islands being warmer than continents,
and mountains colder than valleys; as you
must always remember that knowing the degree
of latitude from which a plant comes is not sufficient
to teach its culture, unless we know also
whether it grows on the mountains or in the
valleys, and whether the climate of the locality
is moist or dry. A plant will be soon killed by
a dry atmosphere, if it requires a moist one; and
it will be as much injured by being kept too hot
as too cold. Furze and heath will not grow
within the tropics; and the first camellias introduced
into England were killed by being kept in
a hothouse.</p>

<p>From what I have said, you will perceive that
as plants will only thrive in climates suitable to
them, it is not enough to have a hothouse for
tropical plants, and a greenhouse for those of
moderately warm countries, but that you must
have three or four houses imitating different climates,
if you wish to grow different kinds of
plants to perfection. Philosophers who have
written on the subject describe sixteen distinct
kinds of climate, including our own; but, as these
would be too many to imitate, gardeners are
obliged to content themselves with the following
kinds of plant-houses and pits.</p>

<p>The <i>dry stove</i> is generally kept at a heat of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
from 70° to 84° in the day, and never allowed to
fall below 65° at night, even in winter. It should
be placed in a situation sheltered from cold winds,
but quite open to the sun; as the plants grown
in it require a strong light, most of them being
natives of dry sandy plains, on which there is no
tree high enough to cast a shade. The plants are
grown in pots, which are generally placed on a
frame or stage of wooden or stone shelves, so as to
have abundance of air around them; and the stove
is best heated by flues. The plants suitable for a
stove of this kind are some of the kinds of Cactàceæ,
such as the genera Melocáctus, Epiphýllum,
and Cèreus, with the tender kinds of Euphórbium,
Mesembryánthemum, Stapèlia, Crássula, Sèdum,
Sempervìvum, and Agàve, and some kinds of
bulbs.</p>

<p>The <i>bark stove</i> has a brick pit filled with tan
or dead leaves in the centre; and it is generally
heated with pipes of hot water or steam, from 60°
at night to 80° in the day; the pots in which
the plants are grown being either plunged in the
tan, or placed on the walls of the pit, or on a stone
shelf near the glass in front. Sometimes the trees
of hot climates are grown in the bark bed in the
centre without pots; and sometimes there is no
bark pit, but the space in the centre of the house
is filled with boxes containing tropical trees. This
last kind is frequently called the botanic stove,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
as it is most common in botanic gardens; and
it is best adapted for growing palms, and other
monocotyledonous plants with large leaves, such
as bananas, which require abundance of air and
light.</p>

<p>The <i>damp stove</i>, or orchideous house, is only
suited for orchideous plants and exotic ferns.
The heat should be from 70° at night to 90° in
the day, or even more; and the house should be
heated with hot flues, on which water should
be thrown twice or three times a day, and hot-water
pipes with open tanks; as all the plants to
be grown in this kind of house require excessive
heat and constant moisture. As they are also
plants that love the shade, the house should have
only a subdued light; and though I cannot say
that I approve of the coloured glass adopted by
some cultivators, as it decomposes the rays of
light, and deprives the plants of a portion of the
heat they would otherwise derive from the sun,
yet I would certainly advise that some of those
climbing plants which will grow in a moist warm
climate should be trained close under the glass,
to produce shade.</p>

<p><i>Forcing-houses</i> for grapes and early stone fruits
are of the nature of the bark stove; and in them
the pit in the centre is frequently filled with
pine-apple plants, in pots plunged up to the rim in
the tan; but these houses belong to the kitchen-garden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
as do pits for growing pines, cucumbers,
and melons.</p>

<p>You will thus observe that there are only three
distinct kinds of hothouses in use in British
gardens, viz. the damp stove, or orchideous house,
which is the hottest; the dry stove, or house for
succulent plants, which is the rarest; and the bark
stove, which is the most common, and which may
be said to have two varieties, viz. the botanic stove
and the forcing-house.</p>

<p><i>The culture of hothouse plants</i> in the <i>bark stove</i>
requires more care than can be expected from
any one not a regular gardener; and, as most
tropical plants are valuable in this country, I
would not advise you to try to manage them
yourself, as you would be very much vexed if you
should chance to kill them. I will, however, give
you a few general hints on the subject, if you
should like to have a house of this kind.</p>

<p>All bark-stove plants require a great deal of
water when they are in a growing state, and,
as it is necessary that the water should be of the
same temperature as the house, there should be
either an open cistern in the house, or a cistern in
the shed behind, near the furnace, and communicating
with the house by a pipe. The best
plan is to have a cistern in the house, as it can be
used as an aquarium; and there are many beautiful
tropical aquatics, such as the different species of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Nymphæ'a and Nelúmbium, which deserve growing
for their beauty, while others are interesting
for their curiosity, such as the Papyrus. In
summer, bark-stove plants require very little care,
except to prevent them from receiving any sudden
check, as, if the heat be not kept up regularly, the
plants are very liable to stop growing, and, when
the heat is renewed, to shoot a second time, and
thus to waste their strength in sickly and imperfect
growth. Great care is also required in autumn
to increase the fire heat in proportion as the
weather grows cold, so as to prevent the plants
from receiving any check from the decrease of
temperature in the atmospheric air, as tropical
plants may be said to have only two seasons, viz.
summer and winter; and thus they should be kept
as nearly as possible at the same heat as long as
they are in a growing state; and then have a
complete change to a season of rest, by never
letting the heat rise higher than from 60° to 65°
during the dark days of winter. During the winter
months very little air can be admitted, on account
of the great difference between the air of the
atmosphere and that within the house; but in
the spring, advantage should be taken of every
warm day, even in March and April, to open the
sashes a few inches wide for half an hour or an hour
in the middle of the day, when the sun shines; but
the house should be shut up immediately if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
sun should go in and the air become chilled.
As the summer advances, air should be admitted
freely, and continued till the beginning of September,
when it should be gradually reduced till
the cold of winter prevents any being given at all.
Most gardeners repot, or shift, as they call it, all
their bark-stove plants about the middle or end of
April; but this is too indiscriminate a practice,
and, therefore, only those should be repotted that
appear to want such an operation.</p>

<p>One of the greatest difficulties attending the
culture of plants in a bark stove is, guarding
against the ravages of the immense number of insects
that are engendered by the heat; and one of
the most troublesome of these is the active little
mite called by gardeners the red spider (<i>Àcarus
telùrius</i>). This little pest breeds in the bark, and
when first hatched it is so small as to be scarcely
perceptible; particularly as it is of a pale green,
nearly the colour of the under side of the leaf, to
which it fixes itself, and there spins a web. As it
gets older it becomes of a brownish red, and having
eight legs, it runs with the greatest rapidity.
It is also furnished with a proboscis, with which it
sucks the juices of the leaves, making them wither
and shrivel up; and thus the flowers and the
fruit of the trees are both spoiled, as neither can
attain perfection unless the sap that is to nourish
them be first properly matured in the leaves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Tobacco smoke, and most of the other usual remedies
against insects, have no effect on the red
spider; and, though sprinkling it with very cold
water will kill it, it is difficult to apply without
injuring the plants. The best remedy is allowing
plenty of air to pass through the house,
whenever the weather is hot enough to allow the
atmospheric air to be admitted with safety.</p>

<p>The culture of the plants contained in the <i>dry
stove</i> requires considerable care. The Cáctus
family may be arranged in three groups; first, the
Tree Cacti, which are included in the genus Cèreus,
and have long slender stems without a single leaf,
sometimes thirty or forty feet high, and not
thicker than a man's arm. These plants grow on
the summits of the mountains in Brazil, and only
require greenhouse heat in England. Secondly,
the Mammillàriæ and Echinocácti, which grow in
the valleys of the temperate parts of South America,
and should be kept in a warm greenhouse
in this country; and thirdly, the Melocácti, the
Epiphýllum, the Opúntiæ, and the Rhípsalis,
which grow in the tropics, and require a dry
stove in England. These plants should be grown
in pots well drained with cinders, and they should
be kept almost without water from October till
March, and then watered profusely till they are
about flowering, when the quantity of water given
to them should be gradually diminished. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
cultivators keep a few of their plants in a bark
stove, and plunge the pots in the tan, and they are
said to thrive on this treatment, if carefully managed;
but as it requires a great deal of care to
prevent them from damping off, the ordinary
way is the safest for an inexperienced gardener.
Mesembryanthemums, which are also kept in a dry
stove, require the same treatment as the Cácti.</p>

<p>The orchidaceous plants grown in a <i>damp
stove</i> are all epiphytes, which, in their natural
state, grow either on the branches of trees,
or on exposed rocks. The former of these are
found in their wild state with their roots hanging
down in the air, and growing in dense forests,
where shade, moisture, and excessive heat are
essential to their existence. Most of these plants,
in a state of culture, are grown in the husks of
cocoa-nuts, half filled with moss, from which the
roots hang down, or they are tied with wire to
pieces of wood hung from the rafters. The wood
generally preferred for this purpose in England
is the robinia, or false acacia, on account of
the roughness of its bark, and the softness of its
wood: and moss is generally put between the epiphyte
and log so as to make it quite compact.
Some genera of orchideous plants, such as
Dendròbium, Epidéndrum, and Cattlèya, are
always grown in pots, which are filled with turfy
peat, chopped moss, and lime rubbish. Others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
such as Stanhòpea and Catasètum, should be
grown in baskets half filled with moss, or in a
curious kind of frame, made of pieces of turf
fastened between four upright pegs of wood; as
the flowers of these plants come from their roots,
and they must be allowed abundance of room to
enable them to protrude properly. The baskets
or frames for the Stanhòpea and other root-flowering
plants should be from three to six inches
deep, and from six to ten inches wide; and the
frames should be filled with strips of turf, two or
three inches wide, piled up on one another so as to
fill the frame, and yet leave a sufficient space between
to admit the passage of the flower stems
which protrude downwards from the root. When
orchideous plants are grown in pots, the pots are
drained with cinders, and then filled with chopped
turf mixed with lime rubbish to keep it open.
The exotic ferns grown in the same house require
no particular care, except that of potting
them so as to insure perfect drainage, and keeping
them frequently syringed overhead.</p>

<p>There may be said to be five kinds of greenhouse;
viz., the Australian house, the common
greenhouse, the heath house, the conservatory,
and the orangery, to which is sometimes added,
the camellia house, though these plants are generally
kept in the conservatory.</p>

<p>The <i>Australian house</i> contains all the curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
New Holland plants, such as Bánksia, Dryándra,
Grevíllea, Melaleùca, Callistèmon, Metrosidèros,
and various genera belonging to the Leguminòsæ,
together with the Cape plants belonging to the
Proteàceæ and Compósitæ. These plants require
a considerable degree of heat, and also as much air
and light as can be given to any plants which
require shelter from the open air. On this account
they are generally grown in curvilinear houses,
that is, houses that have glass on all sides, like
that in the garden of the London Horticultural
Society at Turnham Green. All the plants contained
in this house are extremely difficult to
grow, and they require the greatest care in
watering, so that they may never have too much,
and yet never be suffered to become too dry.
Houses of this kind are generally heated by pipes
of hot water, and kept at a temperature of from
40° to 50° or 60°. There is no pit in the centre,
and the plants are either planted in the ground as
in a conservatory, or kept on a stage formed of
wooden shelves.</p>

<p>The <i>common greenhouse</i> has a brick wall at
the back, with a glass roof at an angle of about
45°, and upright glass at the front and sides. The
plants are grown in pots placed on a stage or
range of wooden shelves rising one above another,
with a path all round, and a shelf for the plants
under the glass in front. All the sashes are made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
to open, as it is essential that there should be a
free circulation of air; and so little fire is necessary,
that one fireplace will be sufficient to heat a
greenhouse from thirty to forty feet long, and
from twelve to fifteen feet wide. The house may
be heated either by hot-water pipes or by flues;
in the latter case the flue should go round at the
front and return at the back, being about twenty
inches high and twelve inches wide. The heat of
a greenhouse of this nature need never be more
than 50° in the day, and it may be allowed to
sink even as low as 35° at night, the object being
merely to keep out the frost.</p>

<p>The <i>heath house</i>, like the Australian house,
requires to be as transparent, and as thoroughly
ventilated, as possible. A heathery, however, is
generally a span-roofed house with a walk down
the centre, and shelves for the plants on each side.
It is usually heated by hot water, the pipes for
conveying which are placed in the centre of the
house. The width of the house should be about
ten feet, and the height in the centre of the span
should never exceed nine, as it is of great importance
to have the plants as near the glass as
possible. The floor of the house should stand one
foot above the level of the ground: and, where
expense is not an object, the house is sometimes
built on arches to insure perfect dryness. All
the windows are made to move in every possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
direction so as to admit of a current of air through
the house, whenever the state of the atmosphere
will permit it.</p>

<p>The <i>conservatory</i> has all the plants growing in
the soil, instead of being in pots and placed on
shelves. It is generally more lofty and architectural
than a greenhouse, and of much greater
extent; and it is frequently attached to the
house, being so contrived that it can be entered
from one of the living-rooms. The temperature of
the conservatory is generally rather warmer than
that of the common greenhouse, as it is kept at
60° during the day, and seldom allowed to fall
lower than 40° at night.</p>

<p>The <i>orangery</i> is a still more architectural-looking
building than the conservatory, and it has
an opaque roof. It is used only for preserving
orange trees and other plants that remain in a
dormant state during the winter, and it requires
no more heat than is absolutely essential to keep
out the frost.</p>

<p>The <i>camellia house</i> is generally formed like a
common greenhouse, but so contrived as to allow
the whole of the sashes to be taken off during the
summer. The plants are kept on stone shelves,
raised one above another; and there is generally
no walk at the back.</p>

<p>Of the culture of the plants in the Australian
house I have already spoken; and of those in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
greenhouse I need only detail the management
during the winter months, as your greenhouse
will, I suppose, be in the reserve-ground, and will
be only used to preserve those plants during
winter which you have kept in other more conspicuous
situations during the summer.</p>

<p>Many persons injure greenhouse plants by keeping
them too warm, and giving them too little air
during winter, and then are surprised that their
plants become sickly and remain without flowering,
notwithstanding all the care and expense that have
been bestowed upon them. No greenhouse ought
to be kept at a greater heat at night than from
35° to 40°; and in the daytime it should not be
allowed to rise above 50°, or at most 52°. When
there happens to be sunshine, the fire ought to
be lessened, and whenever the air is not frosty
the windows ought to be opened from twelve till
two every day. If a greenhouse is kept too warm,
it will induce premature vegetation, and the plants
will waste their strength in an attempt to produce
flowers and fruit, at a season when nature requires
them to be kept in a state of complete repose.
Greenhouse plants should be watered generally
every morning; but in frosty weather water need
not be given every day, and some plants will not
require watering oftener than once a week. This,
however, must depend in a great measure on
circumstances, and, as a general rule, it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
observed, that water may always be given in small
quantities when the surface of the earth contained
in the pot looks dry. The pots should never be
allowed to stand in saucers, as stagnant water is
peculiarly injurious in winter. Whenever the
earth looks black and sodden, the plant should be
turned out of the pot, and, after the black earth
has been carefully shaken from the root, it should
be repotted in fresh soil, an inch or more in the
bottom of the pot being filled in with small pieces
of broken crocks.</p>

<p>In February or March greenhouse plants should
be looked over, and repotted where necessary;
those that are too tall should be cut in, and cuttings
made of their shoots. The young plants
raised from cuttings made in autumn should be
repotted in larger pots for flowering; and where
the plants do not require fresh potting, but have
the surface of their mould become green and
mossy, the moss should be taken off, and the
ground slightly stirred with a flat stick, taking
care, however, not to go so deep as to injure the
roots. When trouble is not an object, all greenhouse
plants are the better for repotting once a
year, either in spring or autumn; and when the
ball is taken out of the pot for this purpose, it
should be carefully examined, and all the decayed
parts of the roots should be cut off. Sometimes,
when the ball of earth is turned out, nearly half of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
it will fall off almost without touching it; and
when this is the case, it will generally be found
that there is a worm in the pot. Worms do a
great deal of mischief to greenhouse plants in cutting
through the roots, as their instinct teaches
them to make their way through the earth straight
across the pot and back again, and they cannot do
this without tearing the roots asunder every time
they pass.</p>

<p>Another point to be attended to in the management
of a greenhouse is, keeping the plants as
near as possible to the glass, as, unless this be
done, the plants will become what gardeners call
"drawn up," that is, they will be unnaturally tall
and slender, from the efforts they make to reach
the light.</p>

<p>As I have frequently mentioned <i>repotting</i>, I
may as well tell you here the best mode of performing
the operation. The pot to which the
plant is to be removed should always have been
previously washed quite clean, and be perfectly
dry. Some bits of broken pots, called potsherds,
should then be put at the bottom of the
pot, the quantity varying from three or four pieces
(so as just to cover the hole) to a mass an inch
in depth, depending upon the nature of the plant.
If the plant has not been in a pot before, the roots
are then placed just above the potsherds, and the
earth is filled in, the plant being occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
shaken so as to allow the earth to get amongst
its roots. The soil is next consolidated by
shaking the pot, and then lifting it up and
setting it down again with a jerk; and is rendered
firm and neat round the rim by means
of a broad smooth piece of stick shaped somewhat
like a table-knife, and called a potting-stick.
When a plant has been in a pot before, and is repotted
or shifted, as it is called, into a pot a size
larger, the plant is turned out of its old pot by
putting the hand upon the earth and turning the
pot upside down; or, if the ball of earth does
not come out readily, striking the rim of the pot
against the edge of the potting-table or shelf.
The ball containing the plant will thus drop out
into the left hand; and the potsherds that adhere
to the bottom of the ball having been picked off,
and any part of the root that appears decayed
having been removed, a little mould is put on the
drainage in the new pot; and the ball of earth,
containing the plant having been placed in the
centre, the space between it and the pot is filled
in with light rich mould, and made firm with the
potting-stick. The operation is concluded by
shaking the pot, and then taking hold of the rim
with both hands, and striking the bottom of the
pot two or three times with a jerk against the
potting-bench. The plant is then watered, and
set in the shade for the remainder of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Heaths</i> are very difficult plants to manage;
but a great improvement has taken place in their
culture within the last few years. They are
grown in what is called heath mould, that is, a
mixture of peat and sand; and when this earth
is put into the pot, it is mixed with good-sized
entire pebbles, some of which are suffered to protrude
through the surface of the soil. The roots
of heaths are extremely fine and hair-like, and
the shelter afforded by the pebbles is so congenial
to them, that, if one of the stones be taken out, a
cluster of fine, white, vigorous roots will be found
below it. The plants are always potted high, so
as to let the base of the stem be above the level
of the rim of the pot, as the plants are very apt
to damp off if the collar of the plant be buried in
the ground. Heaths should never be suffered to
become too dry, and never kept too wet. They
require very little heat; and many experienced
cultivators never apply fire-heat to their heatheries
at all, but merely keep out the frost by having
wooden shutters to the sashes, and covering them
with mats. Heaths, when growing rapidly, should
be repotted whenever the roots have filled the
pot; but they should not be shifted too often;
and, when they have attained their full growth,
they may be suffered to remain in the same pots
three or four years without injury.</p>

<p>As plants in the <i>conservatory</i> are grown in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
free soil, they are in a much more natural state
than any plants can be in pots, and consequently
they require much less care in their culture.
There is usually a walk all round the conservatory,
next the glass, and one down the middle, on
each side of which are the beds containing the
plants, and under which are placed the hot-water
pipes that warm the house. The consequence of
this arrangement is, that the beds on each side
the middle walk are so planted as to have their
highest shrubs in the centre, shelving down to
those of lower growth on each side; and hence
the centre is generally planted with tall camellias,
acacias, metrosideros, eucalyptus, &amp;c.; while
near the walk are placed oleanders, myrtles,
fuchsias of different kinds, together with chorozemas,
and many of the other most ornamental
New Holland plants; and up the pillars that
support the roof are trained kennedyas, bignonias,
ipomœas, and passion-flowers in great variety.
Cliánthus puníceus and Polýgala oppositifòlia
ought to find a place in every conservatory;
and a plant of Wistària sinénsis may be trained
under the rafters so as to afford shade to the camellias;
as, under shelter, the wistaria will flower
twice in the year, and its flowers will yield a delightful,
though very delicate, fragrance.</p>

<p>As it is of the greatest importance to the health
of the plants to have the soil in a conservatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
well drained, many persons form the beds by excavating
pits of the proper size, about two feet and a
half deep, and put at the bottom a layer of brick-bats,
stones, and other materials for drainage, about
six inches thick. On this is deposited a thin
layer of coarse rough gravel; and on the gravel
a layer of rich mould, which should be about two
feet thick in the centre of the bed, where the
largest shrubs are to be planted, and shelving off
to about sixteen or eighteen inches at the sides
next the walks. All the sashes should be made
to open, and there ought to be large glass doors
in front, which should generally stand open during
the day in summer, in order to admit as much air
as possible.</p>

<p>In some places a movable frame is contrived for
a conservatory, into which sashes fit in winter, and
which, in severe weather, is covered with tarpauling,
made to pull down, like a blind, from a roller
along the ridge of the roof; the whole frame
being so contrived as to be entirely removed in
summer. The upright posts of this frame are
let into holes in the ground, like the posts in a
drying-ground, so that when the posts are taken
out, the holes may be stopped up with wooden
plugs with rings attached; and the roof and horizontal
pieces fit into each other, and into the uprights,
the whole being kept firm by bolts. When
a conservatory of this kind is to be removed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
the summer, the side sashes and doors are taken
away first, generally about the middle or end of
April. A week or ten days after, the sashes
of the roof are taken off, but the frame and tarpauling
are left in case of spring frosts; and, when
all danger from these is over, the whole of the
framework is removed, and the orange trees, camellias,
and other exotic trees that have been
planted in the conservatory, appear to be growing
in the open air.</p>

<p>The <i>orangery</i> is often contrived so as to be
used as a kind of living-room during summer, as
it is only intended for the reception of the orange
trees, and other plants belonging to the genus
Citrus, during winter. The trees are generally
grown in large tubs and boxes, in a rich loamy
soil, and are set out in the open air during summer,
when they require but little care, provided
they are frequently watered over the leaves,
though they do not like much water to their
roots. When young plants are raised from seed,
they seldom flower till they have been budded or
grafted from an old tree. Orange trees are generally
put in the open air in May, and kept there
till September or October; and they are very
seldom shifted. They require scarcely any light
or water during winter, and no heat beyond what
is necessary to protect them from the frost.</p>

<p>Some of the varieties of Caméllia japónica are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
sufficiently hardy to grow in the open air in the
neighbourhood of London, provided their roots
and the lower part of their stems are mulched;
that is, covered with straw or litter, and the main
trunk wrapped round with a hay-band a few
inches from the ground. The hardiest kind is
the variegated red. Camellias seldom do well
in pots, except when they are very small, as,
when they attain a tolerable size, the flower-buds
are very apt to fall off without expanding. The
best mode of growing camellias is, therefore,
to plant them in the free soil of a conservatory,
taking care that some creeping plant is trained
along the rafters over their heads, as they do not
like to be exposed to too much sun, unless they
have also a great deal of air, and are frequently
and regularly watered. The soil for camellias
should be peat mixed with a little sandy loam.
The temperature of the camellia house should be
from 50° to 60° during the whole of the growing
season; but, when the flower-buds have formed,
the glasses are generally taken off during the rest
of the summer. Early in autumn, however, when
the flower-buds begin to swell, the glasses should
be put on and the house kept warm, the plants
being regularly watered morning and evening, as,
if the watering be neglected a single day, or if
stagnant water be suffered to remain about the
roots, the flower-buds will be sure to drop off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
without expanding. Camellias do not require
frequent repotting. Small camellias are generally
shifted only once in two years, and large ones,
that is, those above five feet high, not oftener than
once in three or four years. The time for shifting
camellias is just when they have done flowering,
before they are beginning to send out their young
shoots. Great care must be taken when they are
repotted not to bruise the roots, as they are very
easily injured.</p>

<p>Both camellias and orange trees are very subject
to the attacks of the <i>black fly</i>, a kind of aphis.
The best way of destroying these insects is to
syringe the plants well, laying them down on
their sides when they are in pots, or, if they are
planted in the free soil, syringing them with a
garden engine so as to throw the water in a
powerful stream upwards, in order to get at
the under surface of the leaves, where the insects
are generally found. Some persons recommend
fumigating with tobacco smoke; but I
have never found it so efficacious as syringing,
and washing the under surface of the leaves with
a sponge, in case the insects should be very numerous.</p>

<p>I am very glad to find that you have procured
some plants, and that you begin to feel an interest
in the cultivation of your flowers. I do
not at all agree with you, however, in thinking,
that this is merely because gardening has with
you, as yet, the charm of novelty; on the contrary,
I am quite sure that as you become better
acquainted with the subject, you will find your
interest in your garden increase; as gardening is
one of those happy arts in which there is always
some not quite certain change to look forward to,
and to be anxious about. Landscape-gardening
is, however, the highest branch of the art, and it
is the more necessary that you should study it,
as, from the view you have sent me of your house,
it appears to me that the general aspect of your
park is at present very monotonous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>An ancient mansion embosomed in tall trees,
with a fine broad terrace at the back, having
a piece of still water lying like a liquid mirror
below it, and a large park beyond, overgrown
with majestic trees whose lower branches repose
upon the turf beneath them, form a scene which
sounds exceedingly well in description, but is
very wearying to the eye which is destined continually
to rest upon it. It is also not very healthy;
as chilly vapours are sure to rise from the water,
while the mass of trees beyond will obstruct the
free current of air.</p>

<p>You must not, however, suppose from these remarks
that I admire a house in an open exposed
situation, as I think nothing can have a more
bleak and naked appearance. Besides, a house
entirely unsheltered by trees is sure to be a very
uncomfortable residence, from its exposure to the
heat in summer, and the cold in winter. It is,
therefore, most desirable to have a sufficient quantity
of trees near the house to shelter it, and yet
to have numerous openings through those trees to
admit distant prospects, and a free current of air.
If a few openings could, therefore, be made in the
plantations near your dwelling, I do not think
there would be any danger in leaving the water in
its present position; as, from your description,
the house is elevated very much above it, and as,
notwithstanding its appearance of stillness, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
is a current through it. The elevation at which
the house is above the water will also prevent the
unpleasant consequences which sometimes ensue,
when water overflows its banks, and makes its
way into the basement story of a house. As to
your house being on the ridge of a hill, I do not
think that is any objection, as the rise is not very
great on either side, and it is a proof that the
prospect would be good if you would only cut
down a sufficient number of trees to show it.
Houses quite in a valley are frequently damp,
and if on the summit of a high hill they are apt
to be bleak; so that the side of a hill or the ridge
of a knoll is, in fact, the best situation that can be
imagined. Our ancestors, indeed, rarely went
wrong on this subject; and it is quite an extraordinary
case to find an old house badly placed.
In the old times the country gentry lived in
their mansions all the year, and only visited
London occasionally, so that they were more
anxious to make their homes comfortable than
persons of the same rank at the present day, who
live in London, and only visit the seats of their
ancestors as they would a watering-place.</p>

<p>You complain bitterly of your house not having
an extensive view from it. You see nothing but
trees, you say, in whichever direction you look;
and you detest trees, because their foliage is monotonous,
and so thick that you cannot see two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
hundred yards before you. This last is the real
point of complaint.</p>

<p>Forest scenery is extremely beautiful in itself,
and principally from the great variety it presents
in the same objects. A fine tree, even when bare
of leaves in winter, is beautiful, from the delicate
tracery presented by its branches, which look like
the masts and rigging of a large ship, intricate,
yet without confusion. In snow, trees assume
a new character; the weight sustained by the
branches makes them droop, and a thousand
graceful and elegant forms take the place of what
was before a stern and rigid outline. In hoarfrost
trees glisten with a thousand gems, reflecting the
rays of light in so many different colours, that
they remind one of the description of Aladdin's
magic garden. In spring they present vivid ideas
of youth and fertility, and all nature appears
awakening into new and vigorous life; the buds
swell, their coverings burst, and the young leaves
display their tender and delicate green; at first
only half-unfolding their beautiful forms, and
reminding one of a young and timid girl half-wishing
and half-fearing to make her first appearance
in the busy world. Trees now begin to assume
each a new and decided character of its own.
The leaves of no two trees are alike: those of the
beech are of clear dark green, and so thin that
they are almost transparent, and yet they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
deeply marked with a strongly indented feather-like
set of veins. The bark of the beech is clear
and smooth, as though nature had intended it for
the use to which it has so often been applied by
lovers&mdash;to carve on it a fair one's name. The
leaves of the elm are of a thick coarse texture,
rugged and distorted, wrinkled, and of a dingy
green; and the bark of the tree is cut into a
thousand furrows. The leaves of the ash are
light and pendulous, and cut into numerous leaflets;
those of the oak are deeply indented, and
generally grow in tufts. The palmate, drooping
leaves of the horsechestnut contrast with the long,
slender, and nearly erect leaves of the white willow;
and those of the black poplar, which present
a smooth outline, with those of the sweet chestnut,
which are remarkable for their finely indented
edges. In short, the leaves of every tree have
beauties peculiar to themselves, in form as well as
in colour. In autumn these colours become more
decided; the lime trees take a yellowish tint, and
the oak a reddish brown; the liquidambar becomes
of a rich purplish crimson, and the maples and
American oaks show a thousand varied dyes.</p>

<p>Yes, my dear Annie, I repeat, the fault is not in
the trees, for they are beautiful; you dislike them
only because they are so crowded that you cannot
see their beauties. I allow it is a very difficult
task to know how to proceed in a case like yours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Cutting down indiscriminately will never do; the
trees must be thinned, not only with a view to
make openings through the wood, but with care
as to themselves. I think the first point will be,
to find out the handsomest trees among those in
the plantations near the house, in order to see
which you would have left. Some will have been
drawn up so much, and will have been forced into
such awkward forms by their present crowded
state, that they would be hideous if the trees that
now surround them were removed. Others want
room, but have grown so that they may easily be
trained into a better form when space is given to
them. One great point to be attended to is, to
break the present formal outline; but, in doing
so, it is scarcely possible to avoid destroying some
trees that your husband might wish to spare, from
local associations. I hope, however, he will allow
a sufficient space to be cleared, not only to make
your flower-garden, but to allow the plants in it
to grow without being overshadowed by trees.</p>

<p>When the flower-garden is formed it will be necessary
to have a <i>shrubbery</i>, so that the transition
may not be too abrupt from the high state of
culture in a flower-garden, to the wild nature of
the forest trees. This shrubbery, indeed, will
afford the only means of harmonising a newly
laid out garden with the general scenery of the
park, as it will contain, first, dwarf flowering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
shrubs next the garden; then shrubs of a larger
growth, such as the laurustinus and arbutus;
and, lastly, flowering trees, from the different
kinds of Cratæ'gus to those of loftier growth,
such as Pyrus spectábilis, Sophòra japónica, and
the tulip tree, which last equals in height some of
the loftiest forest trees in the park.</p>

<p>When a sufficient space for the flower-garden
and the adjoining shrubbery has been cleared, and
the most interesting trees marked, the next point
is to ascertain what distant prospects will be admitted
by cutting an opening through the wood,
before it is finally decided in what direction the
intended openings shall be made; as, for instance,
if the view of a church or castle would be admitted
by cutting an opening in a particular
direction, that direction should be chosen in preference
to any other, and a vista made in that
line, even though an opening in another line
would be preferable on other accounts. Should
such an object be discovered, you must take care
not to obscure it when planting your shrubbery;
and should the object you wish to catch a view of
be very distant, and not distinctly marked, the
eye may be guided to it by planting some whitish-leaved
low tree, such as Elæágnus angustifòlia,
in the shrubbery, backed by dark-leaved shrubs,
such as alaternus and phillyrea; and again, at a
greater distance, planting an abele tree or white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
poplar in the same direction, where it will be
backed by dark masses of Scotch pines or other
similar trees. Before you make an opening, you
must also ascertain whether any disagreeable objects
will be exposed by your so doing; and,
before cutting down even a single tree, you must
consider what effect its removal will produce upon
the trees around it. You have often told me of
the exquisite taste your husband possesses, and
his fondness for fine paintings: he must, therefore,
be admirably qualified for improving the
scenery round his house himself. Landscape-gardening
is, in fact, but landscape-painting on
the largest scale, and with the noblest materials;
the same taste is required in both.</p>

<p>As the plantations near the house have been
suffered to become so completely overgrown, I
have no doubt those in the <i>park</i> are in a similar
state, and that the park itself will require considerable
improvement. The same general observations
with regard to thinning out plantations will
apply in every case; but in the park I think you
will find it advisable, whenever an opportunity
occurs, to take advantage of any natural feature to
introduce what landscape-gardeners call a scene;
as, for instance, should your park contain a rocky
glen, advantage may be taken of it by planting it
with different kinds of pines and firs, to form an
imitation of alpine scenery, as was done, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
very striking manner, by the late Mr. Beckford
at Fonthill. Another part of the grounds might
be planted in imitation of American scenery,
with magnolias, American oaks, and maples, and
tulip trees, as was done by the late Duke of
Marlborough at White Knights. A pond, in a
secluded part of the grounds might have a degree
of interest given to it by planting its banks
with alders and willows. A variety of similar
scenes will no doubt suggest themselves to you,
which do not occur to me, from my ignorance of
the peculiar features of the place.</p>

<p>I suppose neither deer nor cattle are allowed to
graze in your park, as you speak of several of the
trees sweeping the grass with their foliage. Cows
are particularly destructive to the beauty of park
scenery, as they are very fond of tearing off the
lower branches of the trees, and thus producing
the hard line which looks as though the branches
had been shaved off about five feet from the
ground, and which is called by landscape-gardeners
and painters the browsing line.</p>

<p>It is disagreeable to have even deer come close
to the windows, and they are not only fond of
the young shoots of trees, but they would be decidedly
injurious to your flower-garden and the
clumps of ornamental shrubs in the pleasure-ground.
Should your husband have any deer,
it will be necessary to have some fence or line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
demarcation between the park and the pleasure-ground;
and it is always considered a proof of
skill in the landscape-gardener to conceal such a
fence as skilfully as possible. When an iron
fence is used it is generally extremely slight, and
painted green, so as to be almost invisible; and
when this fence is used, it is sometimes concealed
by a plantation of trees thrown together indiscriminately,
as in fig. 13., or planted artistically
in groups. In other cases a sunk wall, forming a
kind of ditch, is used, which is concealed by plantations;
or iron hurdles are stuck in, and the
line is varied occasionally. Any of these plans
may be adopted in the front of your house, to
protect your garden if necessary.</p>

<p>As I have already alluded to the improvement
that will be effected by introducing a shrubbery
to harmonise the intended flower-garden with
the trees in the park, you will probably wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
to know if any thing of the kind will be required
on the back-front of the house; but in
that case there will be less difficulty, as the
terrace affords an admirable medium for uniting
the architectural stiffness of a mansion with the
beautiful wildness and grace of nature. There is
always a degree of incongruity in passing abruptly
from the stiff symmetrical forms of a building, to
the unsymmetric, though graceful, forms of a tree
left in a state of nature; and it was no doubt a
feeling of this kind which induced our ancestors
to surround their houses with formal architectural
gardens and trees clipped into stiff and regular
forms. In more modern times something of the
same kind was done, by always adding to the
house verandas, porticos, and terraces, which
formed a connecting link between the building
and its grounds. After a time these also were
laid aside; and about the beginning of the last
century, when Brown and his followers would
admit nothing but what they called nature in
garden scenery, the park was allowed to come
close up to the windows of the house, and, as a
writer in the <i>Gardener's Magazine</i> observes, the
inhabitants of the mansion might "leap from
their windows into jungles, and steppes, and
wildernesses, where the lion and the panther
would be more at home than the lady in her
silken sheen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>You will see from these observations that there
are styles marking different periods in gardening,
as well as in architecture; and, in some cases, it is
advisable to preserve a certain degree of similitude
between the style of the garden and that of
the house. Of course, however, this can only be
done as far as is consistent with modern comforts;
and the fact of your house being partly Elizabethan
does not entail upon you the necessity
of having a formal garden with high clipped
hedges, and trees cut into a thousand fantastic
forms, any more than it obliges you to sit in
rooms darkened by stone mullions and small-paned
casements, because the courtiers of Queen
Elizabeth were obliged to submit to such inconveniences.
With regard then to the back-front
of your mansion, I would leave the terrace in its
present form, with its stone alcoves at each end,
as it corresponds so well with the style of that
part of the house which appears to have been
added in the reign of Anne or George I.; and I
would preserve and repair the stone balustrade
with urns at regular intervals, and the stone steps
leading from the terrace, which are all in the
same style as the house; I would also have them
lead into an architectural garden below. The
form of this garden should be quite regular, or, if
you prefer the term, quite formal; and it should
be ornamented with fountains, urns, and statues.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
The natural boundary of this garden is the piece
of water before alluded to, the borders of which
should be planted with a few tufts of shrubs to
break, but not disguise, the regularity of the
outline. On the other side of the water these
tufts must be continued, but in a much wilder
and more natural manner; and here and there
the plantation must take the character of a clump,
and consist of low trees, mingled with shrubs of
the largest size. This will unite the house and
garden with the park scenery as regards the view
from the drawingroom windows, and on the side
of the garden, gravel walks may be carried on
through the various scenery of the park, a stone
bridge being thrown over the water on the side
nearest the entrance-front; and, farther on, a
rustic bridge may be thrown over the stream in a
situation where it is not seen from the house.</p>

<p>I think it very desirable that openings should
be made in several places through the mass of
wood, to admit views of the distant scenery from
the drawingroom; as, for instance, if there is a
church or a tower, or any other object that would
form a suitable termination to a vista. In the
reign of William and Mary, when the Dutch style
of gardening was fashionable, nothing was more
common than long vistas of the kind called <i>patte
d'oie</i>, all springing in rays from one point, and
each terminating in some ornamental object, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
as a temple, an obelisk, or a statue. Some slight
approximation to this style, by cutting long vistas
through your woods, might therefore be very
consistently introduced wherever a suitable occasion
for it may occur.</p>

<p>In planting your <i>architectural garden</i>, you must
observe that it should have rather a different character
from the small garden in front of your sitting-room
window. The architectural garden should
contain standard rose trees, almond trees, double-blossomed
peaches and cherries, the Chinese magnolia,
or yulan tree, and other showy-flowering
trees, planted in company with arbutus, phillyrea,
Minorca box, and other evergreens of a
similar character. In the shrubbery, at each end
of the garden, but not forming part of it, these
trees should be continued, and mixed with variegated
hollies, the different kinds of Cratæ'gus, and
other trees that are ornamental, and that never
attain a large size.</p>

<p>I have already suggested that in various parts
of the pleasure-grounds advantage should be taken
of any natural inequalities that may exist, to form
different scenes; and I have now only to add
that advantage may be taken of singular peculiarities,
should you wish to form in your grounds
one of those arboretums which are now so fashionable.</p>

<p>An <i>arboretum</i> is a collection of trees and shrubs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
in which all the different species of natural order
are planted together; and it does not necessarily
imply that these orders should be arranged in
any particular manner; as indeed botanists are
not agreed as to how they should be placed,
Jussieu having adopted one plan, De Candolle
another, and Dr. Lindley another. The only essential
point is, that all the plants which agree
sufficiently to form an order should be placed together;
as, for example, all the Coníferæ or cone-bearing
trees, such as the pines and firs, the
cedars, the cypresses, and the junipers; and all
the Cupulíferæ or nut-bearing trees, such as the
oak, the chestnut, the beech, and the hazel. Thus
in your grounds, where there is a valley, it may
be formed into what is called an American ground,
consisting of the shrubs allied to the heath family,
and planted with rhododendrons, azaleas, kalmias,
and other similar plants. A glen may be
planted with pines and firs, so as to form it into
a kind of pinetum; and an open space among
trees may be turned into a rose-garden or rosery.
In this way most of the exotic trees and shrubs
that will stand the air in English gardens may
be planted in groups, without going to much expense,
and with less formal appearance than that
of a regular arboretum. Besides, the beautiful
colours which some of the exotic trees will take
in autumn give them a splendid appearance, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
they are backed by other trees with verdant foliage.</p>

<p>The <i>rose-garden</i> will be a very beautiful object
if skilfully arranged; and, by thus forming your
park into a succession of scenes, you will not
only increase its beauty in the eyes of strangers,
but add very materially to your own enjoyments
by increasing the objects of interest within your
reach.</p>

<p>I do not suppose you will have any occasion
to renovate the <i>turf</i> in any part of your park;
but, if you should, the best way is to get a mixture
of the seeds of several sorts of grasses, such
as the fox-tail meadow grass (<i>Alopecùrus praténsis</i>),
the sweet-scented vernal grass (<i>Anthoxánthum
odoràtum</i>), the crested dog's-tail grass
(<i>Cynosùrus cristàtus</i>), and other valuable kinds. If
ever you find a patch of grass has become bare,
have an iron rake drawn over the ground two or
three times, so as to loosen it, and then sow a
few seeds of the grasses I have mentioned, when
the ground is in a tolerably moist state from rain.
This will generally be sufficient; but if it should
not, as the seed of the fox-tail meadow grass is
very often bad, you have only to add a little seed
of the common white clover, and the ground will
appear green in a few days.</p>

<h5>LAYING OUT A KITCHEN-GARDEN.&mdash;MAKING GRAVEL WALKS.&mdash;BOX
EDGINGS.&mdash;CROPS OF CULINARY VEGETABLES.&mdash;CUCUMBERS,
MELONS, AND MUSHROOMS.</h5>


<p>I had not intended saying any thing about the
kitchen-garden, as it hardly comes within a lady's
province; but as you tell me you are so much
annoyed by your old gardener never having the
things you want when you want them, that you
think of forming a small kitchen-garden near
the house, I shall be very happy to give you my
advice as to what appears to me to be the best
method of doing so.</p>

<p>Every kitchen-garden ought, if possible, to be
either square or oblong, for the convenience of
planting the beds, and you will find a garden of
one acre in extent quite as much as you will be
able to manage. I would advise you to have it
surrounded by a wall about ten feet high for
fruit trees; and in front of this wall there should
be a border ten or twelve feet wide; beyond
which should be a gravel walk four feet wide,
leaving a square or oblong plot of ground in
the centre for culinary vegetables. This central
plot may either have a main walk up the centre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
and two or three side walks, or be left all in one
bed, which may be divided into compartments,
with paths between, to suit the convenience of
the gardener. The best situation for your kitchen-garden
will be as near the stable as possible for
the convenience of manure; and, of course, it will
join the reserve-ground. The surface of the
ground should be level, or gently sloping to the
south, and there should be no high trees near it.
The whole of the garden should be well drained,
and you should contrive it so as to have easy
access to either pond or river water. A valley or
a hill is a bad situation for a kitchen-garden; as
the valley is very liable to injury from frost on
account of the damps that hang over it; and the
hill is not only cold, but exposed to injury from
high winds.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that the form of a
kitchen-garden should be either square or oblong;
and I may add, that the walks should always be
straight, as, if they were serpentine, it would be
difficult to wheel a barrow of manure along them
without overturning it. The square form of the
garden, however, is not only on account of the
walks, but in order that the compartment in
the centre may be divided into oblong beds, as
it is most convenient to sow vegetables in straight
lines to allow of weeding and hoeing between
them, earthing them up, &amp;c. The best soil for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
a kitchen-garden is a sandy loam, and the surface
soil should be from two to three feet deep. You
will find it very convenient to have a vinery or
forcing-house close to the kitchen-garden; and
you can either have a small separate garden for
melon and cucumber-beds, called a melon-ground,
or this may form a part of your reserve-ground.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done when you have fixed
upon your ground is to form the <i>walks</i>, marking
them out by two garden lines, and then digging
out the space between in the shape of an inverted
arch, which should be from one to two feet deep
in the centre. The arch is then partly filled in
with brick-bats, stones, or any other hard rubbish
which can be procured, leaving a little hollow
space exactly in the centre to serve as a drain.
Care must be taken, when filling in the rubbish,
to put the largest pieces in first, then pieces somewhat
smaller, and then pieces broken very small,
which are rammed down as hard as possible, so as
to make a smooth surface immediately under the
gravel. The gravel before laying it down should
be sifted, and all pieces larger than a moderate-sized
gooseberry should be thrown on one side.
As soon as the small gravel is laid down and
evenly spread it should be rolled, and this rolling
should be repeated occasionally till the walk becomes
quite hard and firm. If the gravel does
not bind well, it may be improved by mixing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
it powdered burnt clay, in the proportion of one
wheelbarrow full of clay to a two-horse cart load
of gravel. The clay may be burnt by making it
into a heap, intermixed with, and surrounded by,
faggot wood. Gravel walks should always be
slightly raised in the middle, in order that the
water may run off on each side. If you should
have an old gravel walk that wants renovating,
the gravel should be loosened with a pick, turned
over, raked, and firmly rolled, adding a coating of
fresh gravel if necessary. If weeds should appear
on a gravel walk, they are best killed by watering
them with salt and water, and this liquid will
prevent any other weeds from appearing.</p>

<p><i>Box edgings</i> are the best for gravel walks, and
March or April is a good season for planting them.
The following is the mode of performing this
operation, which requires some attention, as the
beauty of the edging depends on its regularity.
The margin of the bed for about a foot in breadth
should be watered, and afterwards beaten firm and
level with the back of a spade; a garden line should
then be stretched along close to the walk, and a
shallow trench opened, sloping towards it at an
angle of rather less than 45°. Some dwarf box
having been procured from the nurseryman, it
should be divided into separate plants, and the
branches and roots trimmed, so that the plants
may be nearly of a size. These are laid along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
the sloping face as regularly as possible, with
their tops rising about an inch above the soil, and
the earth is drawn upon them, so as to fill up the
trench and make them quite firm. The plants are
then watered, and nothing further is required but
to supply the place of any that may chance to die,
and to keep the tips neatly trimmed.</p>

<p>The crops of culinary vegetables are of two
kinds, those that are permanent, and those that
are temporary. Of the <i>permanent crops</i>, the most
important are the <i>asparagus</i> beds, on account of
the great length of time they take in preparing.
The ground must be first trenched three or four
feet deep, and plenty of stable dung buried at
the bottom of the trench. The beds are then
marked out four feet wide, and paths left between
them; and the plants, which must be procured
from a nurseryman (as they should be two years
old when they are first put into the bed), must be
planted in rows nine inches apart, and deep enough
to have the crown of the root two inches below
the surface of the ground. The beds are covered
with rotten manure during winter, which is forked
into the ground in the spring. The asparagus
stalks are not cut till the second or third year
after planting; but after that the beds continue to
produce for twelve or fourteen years, or even
more. All the shoots that push up from April to
Midsummer may be cut off and used for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
table; but those that spring after Midsummer
should be suffered to expand their leaves, in order
that they may elaborate their sap, and thus
strengthen the roots.</p>

<p><i>Sea-kale</i> is planted in beds in the same manner
as asparagus, when the plants are a year old. The
first year the plants will require little care, except
cutting down their flower stems whenever
they appear; but the second year, each plant
must be covered with river-sand, and then have a
sea-kale pot turned over it, on which must be
heaped stable dung fifteen or twenty inches high,
in order that the heat may make the young shoots
grow rapidly, and thus make them tender and
succulent.</p>

<p><i>Artichokes, tart-rhubarb</i>, and <i>horseradish</i>, are
other permanent crops found in kitchen-gardens,
but they do not require any particular care in
their culture.</p>

<p>The <i>temporary crops</i> in kitchen-gardens require
a constant change, as it is found from experience
that the same crop cannot be grown on
the same ground for two years in succession,
without becoming of an inferior quality; and thus
it is found necessary to fix what is called the
rotation of crops, and to arrange that in each
compartment a fresh crop shall be grown every
year, as different as possible from the one that
grew in it the year before. Thus, onions may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
succeeded by lettuces, carrots by peas, potatoes by
cabbages, and turnips by spinach. These plants
may of course be varied according to circumstances;
but the principle is never to have two
fleshy-rooted plants like the carrot and the potato
succeed each other; but always to let a plant
cultivated for its leaves or seeds follow one cultivated
for its root, and so on.</p>

<p>The <i>cabbage tribe</i> is very much improved by
cultivation, but the plants contained in it require
a great deal of manure and frequent watering to
make them succulent and good. It seems strange
that such different plants as broccoli, cauliflowers,
cabbages, Scotch greens, and savoys should all
spring not only from one genus, but from one
species (<i>Brássica oleràcea</i>), which is, in fact, a
British plant, and which I have no doubt you
have seen growing on the cliffs at Dover, though
you would have no idea that a tall straggling
plant, with alternate leaves and very pretty yellow
flowers, could be the wild cabbage.</p>

<p>The first change from this loose-leaved plant
appears to be to what are called Scotch Greens,
Borecole, or Kale; and these plants accordingly
require the least care in their cultivation. They
are generally sown in April, and transplanted in
rows into the kitchen-garden, where they only
need to be occasionally hoed and earthed up.
There are a great many sub-varieties of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
greens, all of which generally come true from
seed.&mdash;Cabbages properly so called have a fine
head or ball formed of leaves folded closely over
each other; and when eaten young, before the heads
have formed, they are called coleworts. Cabbages
are sown three times, for the spring, summer, and
autumn crops. The spring cabbages are sown in
the first week of the August of the previous year,
and in October or November they will be ready
for transplanting into rows twelve inches apart,
where they will remain till they are wanted for
use the following spring. The summer crop is
sown in February, and transplanted in April, the
plants being eighteen inches apart every way; and
the autumn crop is sown in May, and planted out
in July. All kinds of cabbage require a soil well
enriched with animal manure, frequent hoeing-up,
and abundance of water, or they will become
dry and tasteless instead of being succulent. The
stalks of the summer and autumn crops are
generally left standing to produce what are called
sprouts; and some gardeners only grow one crop
of regular cabbages, leaving the stalks standing
during the rest of the season for sprouts.&mdash;Savoys
are large cabbages with wrinkled leaves, which
are sown in March, and transplanted in May or
June to a bed where they stand two feet apart
every way. The crop is generally ready in
November, but savoys are never considered good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
till they have had some frost.&mdash;Brussels Sprouts
are a variety of the Savoy cabbage, and, as they
are said to be very inferior in quality if raised
from seed ripened in Britain, you must inquire if
the seed you purchase has been procured from
abroad.&mdash;Broccoli should be treated like cabbage,
the soil should be deeply trenched and manured
before the plants are transplanted.&mdash;Cauliflowers
require too much care in their culture for me to
advise you to have any thing to do with them.</p>

<p><i>Peas</i> and <i>beans</i> should be grown in an open
sunny situation, and in a light soil that is tolerably
rich, but not freshly manured; and hence they are
well adapted to succeed the cabbage tribe, the soil
for which is always well manured.</p>

<p>Some sow their early peas in November and December,
but very little is gained by this; and, if
the winter should be severe, the crop is sometimes
lost. The best time, therefore, for sowing early
peas is in February, and the late ones in two or
three sowings from April to July. Before sowing,
the ground should be marked for drills, by stretching
a garden line along the length of the bed, and
then making a drill or furrow along it with a
dibber, pressing the earth firm at the bottom of
each drill. As soon as the drill is prepared, the
peas are regularly dropped along it, two or three
to an inch, if they are small, and an inch apart if
large, and then they are covered with the soil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
which is firmly pressed down over them with a
spade or roller. The drills should be an inch and
a half deep, and from two to three feet asunder,
according to the size of the peas, the marrowfats
and blue Prussians requiring more room than
the early kinds. A pint of peas will sow from
twenty to thirty yards of drills, according to the
size of the peas. Dried furze is sometimes put
over peas when they are sown, and before they
are covered with earth, to save them from mice.
If the weather should be dry, the drills may be
occasionally watered; and when the young plants
are two or three inches high they should be hoed
up, the earth being carefully drawn up to their
roots. When about six inches high, they should
be stacked with two rows of sticks to each row of
peas, care being taken to have the sticks higher
than the expected height of the peas, and not to
let them cross at top. Many persons do not grow
any early peas (which are always inferior to the
larger kinds), but sow a crop of dwarf marrowfats
and green Prussians in March and April for
the principal crop, sowing the tall marrowfats and
blue Prussians in June and July for a late crop.
In this manner a supply of fine-flavoured peas may
be obtained all the summer, and in open seasons
till the end of September or October.</p>

<p>Beans are sown at the same time as peas, but
they should be grown in stronger soil; they do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
not require sticks, and they are generally topped,
that is, the upper part of the leading shoot of
each plant is cut off; an operation that would be
fatal to peas.</p>

<p><i>Kidneybeans</i> are of two quite distinct kinds.
The dwarf kidneybeans are annuals, which should
be sown in drills about two feet apart, the first or
second week in May; but the scarlet runners are
perennials, the seed of which should be sown two
or three inches asunder, and very lightly covered;
and the rows should at least be three feet apart.
The plants will require sticks like peas. Kidneybeans
are generally eaten in England only in an
unripe state, the pods being eaten as well as the
seeds; the ripe seeds are, however, commonly
eaten in France under the name of <i>haricots
blancs</i>.</p>

<p><i>Potatoes</i> are propagated by what are called
sets, that is, pieces into which the tuber is cut,
each of which contains a bud or eye. Before
they are planted, the ground should be trenched
and rotten dung dug into it. The early potatoes
are planted in March, and the late ones in May
or June. When the potatoes are to be planted,
a garden line is stretched across the beds, and
holes are made along it with a dibber, about six
inches deep, and nine inches or a foot apart. The
sets are then put into the ground, one in each
hole, with the eye upwards, and the earth firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
pressed down on them. When the plants come
up, they are frequently hoed and earthed up; and
as soon as they come into blossom some cultivators
cut off the tops, to prevent the formation of the
seed.</p>

<p>The <i>Jerusalem artichoke</i> is propagated by sets,
like the potato; and the <i>turnip</i>, the <i>carrot</i>, and
the <i>parsnep</i> are propagated by seed sown in drills
about March.</p>

<p><i>Red beet</i> is cultivated in the same manner, and
plants that are sown in March will have roots
ready for the table in September or October.
Great care, however, must be used while taking
them out of the ground, not to wound the outer
skin; and in the kitchen they must be only
washed and not scraped, as, if the outer skin
should be removed, all the colouring matter will
escape when the root is boiled, and the root, instead
of its being of its usual bright red, will be
of a dingy whitish pink.</p>

<p><i>Radishes</i> are sown at different seasons; generally
every fortnight, from January to July or
August.</p>

<p><i>Spinach</i> is of two kinds: the round-leaved variety,
which is generally sown for the summer
crop in January or February, and the roots of
which may be pulled up and thrown away as soon
as the leaves are gathered; and the Flanders
spinach, which has triangular leaves, and which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
sown for the winter crop in August. This last
kind should have only the outer leaves pinched or
cut off; and, thus treated, it will continue producing
fresh leaves all the winter, as it is quite
hardy, and not injured by frost. The seeds of
this plant will keep good four years.</p>

<p>I do not suppose you will attempt to grow
<i>onions</i>, as they will require a great deal of care;
but you can sow a few in March for salads. If
you wish to grow onions of an enormous size,
you should raise the seed on a hotbed in February,
and transplant them into the open ground in
April or May. The soil into which they are
transplanted should be very rich, and mixed with
charcoal roughly powdered. The onions should
be planted a foot apart every way, only the fibrous
roots being buried in the soil, and they should be
watered regularly every day. All the onion
tribe require a very rich soil, which is very much
improved for them by mixing charcoal with it.
When it is wished to grow onions to a very large
size, a hollow space or cup is made in the ground,
in the middle of which the onion is placed when
it is transplanted, the fibrous roots being buried
in the ground at the bottom of the cup. The
bulb of the onion, when thus treated, and well
watered, swells to an enormous size, and becomes
extremely delicate.</p>

<p><i>Lettuces</i> are of two kinds: the cabbage lettuces,
which may be sown broad-cast at any time from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
February to August, and require no after care,
except thinning out and watering; and Cos
lettuces, which are generally blanched by bending
the tips of the leaves over the heart, and tying
them in that position with a bit of bast mat. Endive
and succory are blanched in the same manner, and
mustard and cress only require sowing, as they are
cut for salads while in their seed leaves. In France,
lettuces are often cut for salads in their seed leaves
like mustard and cress.</p>

<p><i>Celery</i> requires a good deal of care in its culture.
The seed must be sown in March or April, in a bed
the soil of which is formed of equal parts of loam
and rotten dung. When the young plants come
up, they are transplanted into another bed of very
rich soil, and when they are about a foot high
they are removed into trenches for blanching.
These trenches are made four feet apart, eighteen
inches wide, and twelve inches deep, and they
are filled nine inches high with a rich compost of
strong fresh soil and rotten dung. The plants are
taken up with as much earth as will adhere to
their roots; and, their side shoots having been
removed, they are set in the centre of the trench
nine or ten inches apart. As they grow, the earth
is drawn up to them, a little at a time, taking
care never to let the earth rise above the heart of
the plant; and this earthing up is repeated five or
six times, at intervals of about ten days or a fortnight,
till the plants are ready for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>potherbs</i>, as they are continually wanted in
cookery, are much better in a garden near the
kitchen. One of the most important is parsley,
which is generally sown in a drill in February or
March, and the plants of which do not seed till the
second year. Fennel is a perennial, which, when
once introduced, requires no further care, except
to prevent it from spreading too rapidly. Thyme,
sage, pot-marjoram, and winter savory, are all
dwarf shrubs, which require no care after they
have been once planted. Mint, winter marjoram,
and the common marjoram, are perennials; but the
sweet or knotted marjoram, summer savory, and
basil require sowing every year like parsley.</p>

<p>I would not advise you to grow <i>cucumbers</i> or
<i>melons</i>; but, should you feel inclined to try your
skill, you have only to have a hotbed made like
that for raising flower seeds; but with a two- or
three-light frame, remembering that it will take
a cart-load of stable dung for every light. The
plants are raised in pots, and, when they are about
five weeks old, they are planted three together in
little ridges of earth made under each light. When
the plants have produced two rough leaves, the
ends of the shoots are generally pinched off, and
this is called stopping the runners. When the
plants come into flower, the pollen of the male
flowers should be conveyed to the female ones, as
otherwise the fruit very often drops off as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
it is set. Seeds for the first crop of cucumbers are
sown in December or January; but the principal
crop is sown in March. The great difficulty is to
grow the cucumbers long and straight, and to keep
them green, and with a beautiful bloom. For the
first purpose a brick may be placed under the
fruit, and for the second, abundance of leaves
should be left on the plant; and the ground in
which it grows should be kept quite moist, as it
is found that the plant succeeds best when it has
abundance of heat and moisture, and has grown in
the shade. Melons require the same treatment as
cucumbers, with the exception of their beds being
about 10° hotter; as, for example, the seed-bed
should not be less than 65°, and the fruiting-bed
should not be less than 75°.</p>

<p><i>Gourds</i> and <i>tomatoes</i> should be sown in a hotbed
in March, and planted out in May, the latter
against a south wall.</p>

<p><i>Mushrooms</i> are generally grown in the back
shed of a vinery or forcing-house, in beds made of
fresh horse-dung, which has lain in a heap under
cover, and been turned over several times for about
a fortnight or three weeks, till every part has
thoroughly fermented. A bed is then marked out
about twelve or fourteen feet long, and five feet
broad; and, if it is on the earth, a pit is made of
that size by taking out the soil about six inches
deep. The bottom of the bed should be formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
by a layer of long fresh stable manure about four
inches thick. On this several other layers must be
placed of the prepared dung, each being beaten
flat with the fork, so as to make the bed as close
and compact as possible, till it is about five feet
high, when the top should be finished off like the
ridge of a house. In this state the bed should remain
about a fortnight, and then some bricks of
mushroom spawn having been procured from a
nurseryman, they should be broken into pieces
about an inch or an inch and a half square, and
strewed regularly over the bed, each piece of the
spawn being buried by raising up a little of the
dung and inserting it. After this, the surface of
the bed must be beaten flat with the spade, and
the whole covered with a loamy soil, and beaten
quite smooth. The bed is then covered about a
foot thick with oat straw, and again with mats,
and it will require no further care for a month or
six weeks, by which time the mushrooms will be
ready for the table. Care should be taken in
gathering them to twist them up by the roots, as,
if they are cut off, the root, which is left in the
ground, will decay, and be injurious to the young
plants. Mushrooms may be made to grow in
lawns, by procuring some bricks of mushroom
spawn, and, after breaking them into pieces about
an inch or two inches square, burying these pieces
by raising a little of the turf wherever the mushrooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
are wished to grow, and placing the spawn
under it. This is sometimes done in April or
May; but if the season should be dry, the spawn
will not germinate. Others put the spawn into
the ground in August, or in the first week in
September; the lawn is afterwards rolled, and no
other care will be requisite until the mushrooms are
ready for gathering, which will be in a month or
six weeks after the spawn is buried.</p>

<p>The fruit trees in a kitchen-garden should be all
trained against the walls, and those trees which
are grown as standards should be in a separate
garden or orchard. The walls are best when
about eight feet high, and they should have strong
hooks or holdfasts built into them at the top, for
the convenience of supporting a wooden coping, or
of suspending mats or nets. Some persons recommend
the walls to be built on arches; but this is
a bad plan, as it is of importance to the gardener
to confine the roots as much as possible to the
border within the garden. The roots of fruit
trees should never go deeply into the ground, as,
if the roots are suffered to get so deep as to be
out of the reach of the air, the trees will produce
more leaves and branches than fruit. On this
account care should be taken that the soil should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
not be more than eighteen inches deep; and the
easiest and most effectual mode of doing this is,
to dig out the border to the depth of two feet,
and put a layer of brick-bats and other rubbish
covered with gravel well rammed down to the
depth of six inches, and to fill up the remaining
eighteen inches with a fine rich mould. When a
fruit tree border is in its proper state, the gardener
should always be able to show the fibrous roots of
his trees by removing a little of the earth with his
hand. When the trees are planted the roots should
be carefully spread out to their full extent, and
care should be taken always to keep the collar of
the plant above the earth, as when it is buried
the tree is very liable to become cankered. As
the blossoms of peaches, apricots, and nectarines
appear early, they are very liable to be
injured by spring frosts, and many plans have
been devised for protecting them. All, however,
are liable, more or less, to objection, as it is extremely
difficult to put up mats without knocking
off the blossoms. The best way is to have a deep
wooden coping placed on the holdfasts that were
let into the wall, with hooks in front, from which
a curtain of bunting may be suspended, which
should be kept up night and day during frosty
weather; as there is quite as much danger from
the sun during frosty weather, as from the frost.
In fact, in most cases where plants are injured by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
frost, it is in consequence of a warm sunny day
having succeeded a severely cold night.</p>

<p><i>Peaches</i> and <i>nectarines</i> are the most valuable
of our wall fruit trees. They should be grown
in tolerably rich soil, but which has been enriched
with decayed leaves rather than animal manure;
as, when they are manured with dung, they are
very apt to produce what are called water shoots
or gourmands, that is, strong vigorous shoots
without any blossom buds. Peach trees are generally
kept in the nursery till they are three or
four years old, and they should be removed about
the latter end of October, or the beginning of
November. They are best trained in the fan
manner, that is, with the branches spread out
regularly against the wall in the shape of a fan;
and, as they always bear their fruit on shoots of a
year old, those shoots must be left on in pruning,
and the old wood cut out. The pruning should
be performed either in November or February;
but the trees should never be cut during a severe
frost. When the fruit has stoned it is thinned
out, and never more than two should be left
growing together.</p>

<p>Peaches and nectarines are generally grafted
close to the ground, so as to make dwarf trees,
and they are considered best planted about twenty
feet apart, with some kind of plum or cherry,
grafted standard high, placed between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Apricots</i> are trained somewhat horizontally,
and they bear not only on the shoots of the last
year, but on close spurs formed by the two years'
old wood. Apricot trees are very apt to have
large limbs die off without any apparent cause;
but this may be prevented by covering all the
principal limbs in October with hay-bands, and
letting them remain on till all danger is over from
frost. Apricot trees should be five and twenty
feet apart on the wall, as they spread rapidly, and
do not bear cutting in. The fruit should be
thinned in May, or the beginning of June.</p>

<p><i>Plum trees</i> will bear a little manure being laid
on the surface in autumn, and slightly forked in
in spring. They are trained horizontally, and they
bear on what are called spurs; that is, short
rugged-looking little branches, jutting out from
shoots two or three years old, and which will continue
fruitful for several years. Plum trees,
in consequence, require very little pruning; and,
in fact, as they are apt to gum when they are
wounded, they should be very seldom touched with
a knife.</p>

<p><i>Cherry trees</i> resemble plum trees in their culture,
and, when grown against a wall, most of the
kinds are trained horizontally, and their branches
kept six or eight inches apart. The morello cherry
is, however, an exception to this rule, as it requires
pruning and training, like the peach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fig trees</i> should never be pruned, except to
remove shoots that cannot be trained, as the fruit
is produced on the young wood at the extremity
of the branches. Fig trees should be planted
thirty feet apart, and trained horizontally, their
long branches being bent backwards and forwards,
in order to make them throw out side shoots for
bearing fruit, which they will generally do where
the bend is made. Fig trees require to be well
supplied with water, though they will not grow
if any stagnant water be suffered to remain about
the roots.</p>

<p>The <i>pomegranate</i> resembles the fig tree in producing
its flowers only on the points of its shoots,
and on short twigs projecting from its trained
branches. Pomegranates require a rich soil; and
when it is wished to throw them into fruit, the
blossoms should be shaded during the time of
expansion, as otherwise the pollen will dry up
without fertilising the stigma.</p>

<p><i>Grapes</i> are frequently grown against a wall in
the open air; and in some cases, as, for example,
by Mr. Clement Hoare, near Southampton, with
very great success. Grapes have been also produced
of excellent quality against a flued wall;
that is, a hollow wall heated by means of flues in
it, as at Erskine, near Greenock; but as, in both
cases, extraordinary care is required, I would advise
you only to have a common sweet-water vine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
or two in your garden on the open wall, for the
purpose of using its leaves in garnishing, and to
grow vines in a vinery to produce the grapes you
require for the table.</p>

<p>A vinery is a common hothouse or bark stove,
heated with hot-water pipes or flues, and with a
pit in the centre, which is generally filled with
tan for pines. This appears a very simple and
economical arrangement, but it has one great disadvantage;
namely, that the pines require heat
at a season when the vines should be in perfect
repose, unless very early crops of grapes are desired.
In other cases the centre of the vinery is
planted with peach and nectarine trees for early
forcing, the branches of the trees being trained
over a curved trellis, and other peach and nectarine
trees or vines, planted in the house, being
trained against a trellis at the back. The vines
for the main crop are, however, planted on the
outside of the house, in a border prepared like
that for the fruit trees, but richer; and their
stems are brought into the vinery, through holes
left for that purpose in the front wall. Several
compositions have been recommended for making
a compost for a vine border; but that most approved
is, two parts of turfy loam mixed with one
part of very rotten dung or decayed leaves, one
part of lime rubbish, and one part of road drift.
On the Continent they frequently bury the parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
cut off the vine in pruning, in the border, and this
is said to make excellent manure.</p>

<p>Vines are generally not planted in the border till
about a year old, and they are best struck from
cuttings of one bud or eye each, with about half
an inch of stem left above and below the eye;
the cutting is then planted in a small pot (60),
and covered with soil half an inch thick, after
which the pot is plunged to the rim in a common
hotbed, or into the tan-pit in the centre of the
vinery, covering it in the latter case with a hand-glass;
the object being to keep the young plant
growing in a moist heat of 60°. The young
plants should be afterwards shifted into larger
and larger pots, as they require it; and their
stems, which will grow rapidly, should be trained
either to a single stick or to a framework of
sticks tied together, according as the plant is
wanted to be spreading or trained to a single
stem. If the eye has been a large and healthy
one, and the wood of the stem from which it was
taken firm and well ripened, the cuttings will
grow rapidly. Care must be taken to give the
young plant a gentle sprinkling of water every
four or five days, and to let it have plenty of air,
and not too much heat from the bed. The water
should be given at night, and the glasses of the
frame should be shut close immediately, as the
steam thus generated is found very beneficial to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the young plant. As when the plant is shifted
the first time the stem, or cane as it is called, is
generally six or eight inches long, great care must
be taken not to injure either it or the spongioles
of the roots in shifting; and, as the stem or cane
is of course always longer every time the plants
are shifted, additional care is required every time
of performing the operation. While the plant is
in the hotbed, the wires or tendrils, and also the
weak lateral shoots, must be pinched off as fast as
they are produced.</p>

<p>If the cutting was made in the first week of
March, and has been properly treated, it will
have a strong stem of ten or twelve feet long,
and perhaps more, by the middle of June or the
beginning of July. Many gardeners advise planting
the vines out at this season, as they say they
grow more vigorously, and form better wood, with
only their stems in the hothouse, than when they
are confined to the moist close heat of the bed.
Other gardeners, however, keep their young vines
in the pots till the following February, when the
canes are generally five feet long, and as thick as
the little finger.</p>

<p>When the plants are put into the ground there
should be one vine to each hole; and, as every
hole is made opposite a rafter, there is thus one
vine allotted to every sash or light. A shallow
pit is made in the ground for each vine, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
the pot being either broken with the spade or
the plant carefully turned out of it, the ball of
earth containing the roots is placed in the pit, in
such a manner as to leave the cane as nearly as
possible in the same position as it occupied when
the plant was in the pot. The ball of earth is
then covered with light rich mould about two
inches thick, and the stem of the vine is brought
through the hole in the wall into the house.
This is an operation of some difficulty, particularly
if the cane be long, and it is carefully
wrapped up in matting or in hay-bands, to prevent
it from receiving any injury. While the
vines are in pots they are pruned, so as to leave
only the main shoot, or at most two shoots,
in case one should be broken off; and in the
latter case, as soon as the main shoot has been
safely introduced and attached to the rafter, the
other is removed. The side shoots are also taken
off as they appear till the main shoot has reached
nearly to the end of the rafter, when its point is
pinched off, and the strongest of the side shoots
are allowed to develop themselves.</p>

<p>If the vine was planted in May or June the
same year the cutting was struck, and nothing else
is in the vinery, it should be allowed to remain
all summer with the glasses off, and without fire
heat; in September, however, the glasses should
be put on, and enough heat applied to keep the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
temperature of the house at 55° or 60°, but always
giving air in the middle of the day, in order to
ripen the wood. In December, when the leaves
begin to fall, the vines should be pruned, and
they should then have a season of rest, till the
leaf-buds begin to swell in spring. When only
vines, or vines and peaches, are grown in a
vinery, it is easy to give this season of rest by
leaving off all fire heat, except what is necessary
to keep out the frost, till the middle of February;
but, when pines are grown in the same house, the
stems of the vines are generally drawn out of the
house during part of December, January, and
February, and kept on the outside carefully
wrapped up in mats and hay-bands, or laid along
the ground and covered thickly with dead leaves
and straw. The vine border should always be
covered in the same manner during frosty weather,
as neither stems nor roots should ever be
exposed to a greater degree of cold than 40°.
When the vines are planted out in June, they
should not be suffered to bear any fruit that year;
but, when they are not planted out till the February
following, they may be allowed to bear one
or two bunches each the following summer.</p>

<p>In pruning the vine great care should be taken
never to cut close to a bud or eye, but generally
to cut through the stem just in the middle of
the internode or space between the buds, or at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
least half an inch from the bud left. The sap of
the vine rises with great force; and if the pruning
be delayed till spring, or if the cut be made too
near the bud, the sap will flow profusely, and will
very seriously weaken the plant. English gardeners
call this overflowing of the sap bleeding; but on
the Continent they call it the tears of the vine.
There are three modes of pruning and training
the vine; but the best for vineries is what is
called the spurring-in system. This consists in
training the plant with one long main shoot, which
is always suffered to remain, and shortening the
strongest of the side shoots to one or two eyes
every winter, and removing those that are weakly,
or that grow too closely together, as the shoots
left, which are called the spurs, should always be
about twelve inches apart.</p>

<p>The time of beginning to force grape vines
depends upon the season at which the grapes
are wanted, but the usual season is February.
The cane of the vine is then taken into the
house, if it has been wintered outside, and carefully
trained to the rafter, the part next the
ground being still kept wrapped round with hay-bands,
and the hole stopped close round the stem,
so as to prevent the vine receiving any check from
the cold of the external air. Want of attention
to this particular is very apt to produce a disease
in the vines, which ends in what is called shanking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
that is, a shriveling of the short stems of the
grapes after they have set. The vine border has
then its winter covering removed; and, after being
forked over, a coating is laid on of rotten dung,
two or three inches thick; or, what is better, a
coating is laid on of turfy loam chopped up, and
old lime mortar, about two inches deep, and on
that a coating of rotten dung, two inches thick;
over these may be replaced the coating of decayed
leaves a foot thick, and straw or reed mat, which
was laid on the bed during the severe frosts of
winter. The grand point is, to keep the roots and
part outside the house in the same temperature as
that within, or even warmer.</p>

<p>When fire heat is first applied, the thermometer
should be 55° at night, and 60° or 65° in the day;
but the heat should be gradually increased as the
buds begin to swell, keeping the heat at night
about 10° lower than that of the day till the
flower-buds appear, when the spurs are generally
stopped about one bud beyond the flower-bud,
and the leaf-shoots, which are opposite the flower-buds,
are each stopped at a single leaf. The
bunches must also be thinned, and not more than
nine or ten allowed to each vine, if trained in the
spur manner. The heat of the house should now
be about 80° by day and 70° by night, and a little
air should be given for half an hour every day,
whenever it can be done without lowering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
temperature below 74°. The hot-water pipes or
flues should be frequently sprinkled with water
when the vines are going out of flower, and the
grapes beginning to swell; and the grapes in each
bunch should be thinned out with a pair of
scissors, and the shoulders of the bunches tied up
to allow the grapes to swell. The house should
now be at its greatest heat, viz. 85° by day, and
74° or 75° at night; air should be given freely,
whenever it can be done without lowering the
temperature below 77°; and the hot-water pipes
should be sprinkled with water six or eight times
during the twenty-four hours. When the fruit
begins to change colour for ripening, this sprinkling
should be left off, and air admitted freely,
even at night, whenever it can be done without
lowering the temperature too much. During the
whole of the forcing, the border should be watered
with dung water; and, as soon as all danger from
frost is over, the leaves and straw should be
thrown off, and the bed slightly forked over, to
admit the warmth of the sun to penetrate the
earth, and the air to reach the roots of the vines,
as unless the air is allowed to reach the roots the
grapes will not set well.</p>

<p>If the forcing was commenced in February,
the grapes will be ripe in July and August; the
Sweetwaters ripening first, the Hamburgs next,
and the West's St. Peter's and Muscat of Alexandria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
last. When grapes are wished to be ripe
in May or June, the forcing must begin the first
of December, and pines may be grown with the
same heat as will be required for the vines; but,
when this is the case, the vines must have an
artificial winter given to them, by ceasing all fire
heat as soon as the fruit is cut, and taking off the
sashes; the stems are afterwards kept in the
shade, and as cool as possible through September
and October, and they are pruned in November.
When, on the contrary, grapes are not required
before September, very little forcing is requisite;
but the bunches of grapes must be carefully
thinned, and not more than ten or twelve bunches
should be allowed on each vine. When the vines
are in flower and the fruit setting, the house
should be kept close, and the pipes or flues
frequently sprinkled with water; as a hot dry
air makes the calyx shrivel up before the pollen
has reached the ovary, and, when this is the case,
the grapes will be small and frequently without
stones.</p>

<p>It would take too much space to explain to you
the other methods of training and pruning, and I
need only say that the long method, which is the
only one except the spur system in general use,
consists in cutting out the old wood every second
year, and supplying its place with wood of the
previous season's growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>You will thus see that the principal points to
be attended to in the culture of the vine are:&mdash;1.
To prune the plants so as to prevent them
from forming too much wood, but not to cut too
near the buds; 2. To keep the roots and collar
of the plants, when forcing begins, at the same
temperature, or nearly so, as the upper part of the
stems; 3. To admit air to the roots as soon as
all danger is over from frost; 4. To thin both
the branches and grapes properly and in due
time; 5. To keep the air of the house moist
when the fruit is setting and swelling; and
6. To give the plants a proper season of rest.</p>

<p><i>Pines</i> are propagated by crowns, that is, the
bunch of leaves on the upper part of the fruit;
or suckers which form by the side of the old plant.
These are potted in small pots in proportion to
their size, in a soil composed of seven eighths of
pure loam and one of silver sand; and plunged
about two thirds of their depth into a bed of tan,
at the heat of about 95° in the bed, and the usual
heat of a forcing-house in the atmosphere, if
grown in the vinery. Young plants are sometimes
grown without pots in propagating-pits;
from which they are transferred, after being repotted,
to what are called succession pits; and,
after remaining there a long time, they are either
removed to the tan-pit in the vinery to fruit, or to
fruiting-pits. I shall not attempt to give you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
directions for their culture during all these
changes, which take up a great deal of time;
Jamaica pines being two years before they are
ready to cut, Providence pines about twenty or
two and twenty months, and Queen pines sixteen
or eighteen months. Your only chance of growing
pines is, therefore, not to have them till they
are put into fruiting-pots; these are plunged into
the tan-pit in the vinery in February or March,
when the forcing of the vines begins; and afterwards
they will require no other care than watering
them frequently, and keeping the atmosphere
moist, to make the fruit swell. Pine-apples are
sometimes grown without pots, in peat soil,
through which pipes of hot water are carried so as
to heat the earth to 95°, while the atmosphere is
kept moist, and decayed leaves are laid on the
surface and drawn up round the plants. In this
way, Queen pines have been grown to the size of
five or six pounds, and New Providence pines
from twelve pounds to fifteen pounds.</p>

<p>When <i>peaches</i> are forced in a vinery, the trees
should be three or four years old before they are
put into the house. The best kinds are, the Grosse
Mignonne, the Royal George, the Bellegarde, and
the Late Admirable; and, where only one kind is
wanted, the Bellegarde is preferred, as it is not so
liable to the mildew as the others. The best
kinds of <i>nectarine</i> for forcing are the Elruge and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
the Violette hâtive. If the forcing begins in December,
the fruit will be ready in May. The
leaves should be frequently syringed with water
at the temperature of the house; and, in other respects,
the culture is the same as for peaches in
the open air, and the forcing the same as for
vines. The greatest objection to growing peaches
in a vinery is, that the shade thrown by the leaves
of the vines prevents the proper colouring and
flavouring of the fruit.</p>

<p><i>Standard fruit trees</i> should never be planted in
a kitchen-garden, as from their drip and shade it
is impossible to grow good culinary vegetables
under them; while, on the other hand, the constant
digging and movement of the soil required
for culinary vegetables, make the roots of the
trees descend so far that they get beyond the
reach of the air, and can never produce good fruit.
Dwarf standards are fruit trees grafted near the
collar of the plants, and trained in various ways
to form bushes rather than trees. Sometimes a
hoop is placed inside, and the branches are trained
into a cup-shape; at others, the branches are formed
into a kind of umbrella; and, at others, they are
trained into the shape of a distaff (<i>en quenouille</i>), or
like a pyramid. All these and many other modes
of training dwarf standards may be seen at the
London Horticultural Society's Garden at Chiswick:
but only pears, apples, and dwarf cherries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
are treated in this manner; and, though they are
convenient to gather the fruit from, they are in so
unnatural a state as to be subject to canker and
other diseases, and seldom live long. Espalier
trees are subject to the same objections, as they
are in a still more unnatural state than dwarf
standards. The hardy kernel and stone fruits are
therefore best grown in an orchard, and I shall
now say a few words on their treatment.</p>

<p><i>Apples</i> are the most useful of all fruits, and
there are three distinct kinds, the dessert or eating
apples, the kitchen or baking apples which fall or
become soft in cooking, and the cider apples which
are good for nothing but cider. Apple trees are
generally grafted on crab stocks; and, when they
are planted, the collar should be raised a little
above the soil, as if it is buried the tree will very
probably become cankered, or affected with the
American blight. Canker is sometimes cured by
cutting out the cankered part, and admitting air
to the roots; and the insect called the American
blight may be removed by washing the tree with a
brush and soft soap and warm water, or by plastering
it over with a mixture of stiff clay and water.</p>

<p><i>Pear trees</i> are very apt to send their roots down
to a great depth, and then cease bearing; so that
it is desirable to keep the roots near the surface
by mulching with manure or dead leaves. The
fruit is produced on spurs, and when pear trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
are grown against a wall they are trained horizontally,
with short projecting branches or spurs.
Pear trees against a wall are very apt to bear
their fruit in clusters, and to leave a great part of
the tree barren; and this arises from their flowers
having naturally very little pollen, and, where the
flowers are exposed to great heat, the pollen drying
up without fertilising the stigma. The best
remedy is to syringe the branches occasionally,
and to shade them when in blossom.</p>

<p>The <i>quince</i> thrives best near water; as does
the <i>medlar. Mulberry trees</i> are best planted on
a lawn, for the convenience of picking up the
fruit clean from the grass; as it falls as soon as it
is ripe. <i>Plums</i> and <i>cherries</i> require no particular
care when grown as standards, except to be
sparing in the use of the knife, as both trees, when
wounded, are very apt to produce gum; and this,
which is an unnatural exudation of the sap,
similar to the bleeding of the vines, is very injurious
to the trees.</p>

<p>The <i>almond</i> is a kind of peach tree, with a
leathery fruit instead of a juicy one, the almond
being the kernel of the stone. The bitter almond
abounds in Prussic acid; but this powerful poison
scarcely exists in the kernel of the sweet variety.
Almond trees are generally grafted on plum
stocks; and they should be grown in a dry soil
and a sheltered situation, as the branches are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
brittle and apt to be broken off by high winds.
When almond seeds are sown, the sharp end
should be pressed downwards; and the young
plants should not be transplanted except when
absolutely necessary, as they have very long tap-roots.
When the almond is planted for ornament
it should have a back-ground of evergreens, as its
flowers appear before its leaves.</p>

<p>The <i>walnut</i>, being a spreading tree with large
leaves, should only be planted where no injury will
be sustained by a deep shade being cast upon the
ground; but it must be observed that its leaves are
disliked by all cattle, and are injurious to cows.
In pruning it the tips of the branches should be
taken off, to make them throw out fruit-bearing
shoots.</p>

<p><i>Sweet chestnuts</i> are always propagated by seeds,
and never grow well unless the soil contains a
portion of sand. The wood is worthless when old.
Both walnuts and chestnuts are generally planted
in the park.</p>

<p>The fruit shrubs grown in gardens may be
considered to include the <i>elder</i>, the <i>berberry</i>, and
the <i>filbert</i>, though these are frequently called
trees. The elder and the berberry will grow anywhere,
and require no particular care in their
culture; the filbert is only a variety of the common
hazel, and both are generally grown on the
borders of walks, where they are planted from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
five to ten feet apart, according as they are to be
trained upright or spreading. As the fruit is produced
on the young shoots, the bush should be
kept open and trained in the cup fashion, in order
that the main branches may throw out short
young wood. Filberts are propagated by sowing
the seeds; and hazel trees by suckers, which they
throw up in abundance.</p>

<p><i>Gooseberries</i> are generally propagated by cuttings,
which strike easily; and they should be
grown in soil which is well drained, and well
manured by a coating of rotten dung being laid
upon it every third year. The bushes should be
planted in rows eight or ten feet apart, the plants
being about six feet from each other. They should
be pruned twice a year; in the winter to remove the
branches not likely to produce fruit, and early in
summer to remove those shoots that are not likely
to ripen. The fruit is produced partly on the old
and partly on the young wood, and it should be
thinned when gathered green for pies and puddings,
by taking only a few from each bush, instead of
gathering all that may be wanted from one.</p>

<p><i>Currants</i> are raised from cuttings generally
about a foot long, all the buds from which are
taken off, except five or six at the top; and the
cutting is then firmly fixed in the soil about six
inches deep. The currant bears chiefly on spurs
of the old wood, so that these only are generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
left in the winter pruning. The currant is very
hardy, and will grow in any soil or situation, even
under the drip of trees.</p>

<p><i>Raspberries</i> always bear on the young shoots,
so that the art of pruning them consists in cutting
out the old wood. They are propagated by suckers,
and thrive best in a light rich soil, and an
open situation.</p>

<p>The <i>cranberry</i> is generally grown in moist soil
or peat earth; but it may be grown in beds in the
common garden like the strawberry. When cranberries
are once planted they require no after
care, except removing the runners when they extend
too far.</p>

<p>Having now, I believe, told you a little, though
I confess not much, of all the kinds of trees and
shrubs usually grown in this country for their
fruit, I have only to say a few words of strawberries
and tart-rhubarb, and then I think I shall
have given you all the information you will require
for so small a garden as yours.</p>

<p><i>Strawberries</i> are rather difficult plants to
give directions for, as they succeed apparently
equally well with different kinds of treatment.
It is certain, however, that they like a deep rich
soil, well manured; and that, when a new strawberry
bed is planted, the ground should be
trenched at least two feet deep, and a good deal
of rotten dung (the dung from an old hotbed is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
best) should be mixed with the soil. Some
persons make fresh strawberry beds every year,
and some every third year; but strawberry beds
will continue to produce for ten or twelve years,
if a thick coating of decayed leaves be put on the
bed every winter, and their remains forked into
the bed in spring. When a new bed is to be
formed, the strongest runners should be selected
from the old plants; and they may be planted in
beds containing three rows each, eighteen inches
apart, the plants being about twelve inches apart
in the line. Alpine strawberries may be raised
from seed, and will fruit the first year. The
Pine is an excellent strawberry for flavour, but
Keen's seedling is the best for general use. The
Hautbois requires a great deal of manure, and,
as the male and female flowers are on different
plants, nearly one half the plants in a bed are
unproductive. Strawberries grow very well on
banks facing the south or south-east, or on little
terraces supported by walls, but in these situations
they must be regularly watered twice a day.
Strawberry plants never produce good fruit unless
they have abundance of leaves, as shade is essential
to the fruit being juicy and of a good flavour.
Most gardeners take off the runners in August or
September, and plant them in nursing beds for
the winter, transplanting them to their proper
beds in March.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Tart-rhubarb</i> is propagated by seed or by
division of the root, but the former method is
generally considered the better. When beds of
rhubarb are to be formed, the soil should be
deeply trenched and richly manured, and the seed
then sown in drills two feet apart for the scarlet
rhubarb, and three feet apart for the larger kinds.
When the plants come up they should be thinned
out so as to leave the plants about the same distance
apart as the rows are asunder. A few leaves
may be gathered from each plant the second year,
but it is generally considered to strengthen the
plants if no leaves are gathered from them till the
third year. Rhubarb may be forced in the open
garden by putting pots over it, in the same manner
as is done for sea-kale; or the plants may be
taken up and potted, after which they may be
placed in the kitchen near the fire and covered
with matting or old carpet, being watered every
day with warm water.</p>

LAYERS AND CUTTINGS.&mdash;BUDDING, GRAFTING,
AND INARCHING.&mdash;PRUNING AND TRAINING.&mdash;DISBUDDING.&mdash;MANURING.&mdash;KEEPING
FRUIT IN A FRUIT-ROOM.</h5>


<p>Digging is the first operation necessary in gardening,
as nothing can be done in the way of
cultivating the soil till it has been first pulverised,
so as to allow the fine delicate roots of the plants
to penetrate among its particles. It is also necessary
that the air should have access to the
roots of plants, as they depend for their nourishment
almost as much on the carbon and other
elements which they absorb from the air, as on
those which they obtain from the soil. On this
account it is necessary, not only to dig the soil
well before any thing is planted in it, but also to
fork it over occasionally whenever its surface becomes
hardened and impervious to the air and
rain. When manure is applied also, it is customary
to dig it into the soil; and ground is occasionally
trenched in order to bring up fresh
soil to the surface, whenever the surface soil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
appears to be exhausted and to want renewing.
The operation of digging requires considerable
strength, as it requires first to be able to force the
spade into the ground, and then to raise as much
earth as will lie upon the blade and turn it over.
It is, however, a fine healthy occupation, not only
from its calling the muscles into vigorous action,
but from the smell of the new earth being particularly
invigorating; and you might have a
lady's spade, with a smooth willow handle, that
will enable you to dig a small bed without much
difficulty. You will be surprised, however, to
find, if you try the experiment, that there is an
art in digging as well as in every thing else; and
that it is extremely difficult, both to dig in a
straight line, and to make the ground look even
tolerably level after it has been dug over. <i>Raking</i>,
though it appears so simple, also requires
considerable skill to make the ground look smooth
and perfectly level. <i>Forking</i> is not so difficult,
as it merely requires to have the fork pressed
into the ground, and then pulled backwards and
forwards, so as to loosen a portion of the soil
without turning it over.</p>

<p>There are two sorts of <i>hoes</i>: the <i>draw-hoe</i>,
which is used for drawing up the earth to any
plant that is to be earthed up; and the <i>thrust-hoe</i>,
which is principally used for destroying weeds.
There are many varieties of both these forms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
but the common kinds, I think, you will find the
best. The most useful instrument, however, for
you will be a <i>trowel</i>, and this you will find indispensable,
as, without it, you will not be able either
to transplant or pot a single plant. Some persons
use what is called a <i>transplanter</i>, to enable
them when they take up a plant, to remove it
without disturbing the roots; but, as far as my
own experience goes, I think these instruments
are more troublesome than advantageous, and I
prefer using a trowel. You will also want a
<i>budding-knife</i>, and a sharp knife for making cuttings;
and you will find a pair of <i>pruning-shears</i>
with a sliding-joint extremely useful for cutting
off dead wood, or removing any badly-placed
branches.</p>

<p>Plants are propagated either by seed, or by division.
When they are to be propagated by <i>seeds</i>,
the ground must be either dug or forked over and
made level. It is then firmed by beating it with
the flat part of the spade, rolling it, or in any
other manner; and the seeds are scattered over it,
if they are to be sown broad-cast, and covered
with earth the same thickness as themselves.
When seeds are to be sown in drills, a narrow
furrow must be made, by drawing a stick along
the ground in a straight line, or in any other way
so as to make the bottom of the furrow firm, and
the seeds must be dropped into it at regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
distances. The furrow is then filled in, so that
the seeds may be covered to the same depth as
their own thickness; and the earth is slightly
pressed down, and afterwards raked over. Larger
seeds are sown in separate holes made by a dibber,
as are the sets of potatoes; but the after processes
are the same in all. Bulbs and tubers are also
planted in the same manner; taking care that the
eyes of the tubers are uppermost, and the flat part
of the bulbs downwards. In planting Ranunculus
tubers the claws should be downwards, and if any
are broken they should be cut off smooth with a
sharp knife.</p>

<p>There are several ways of propagating plants
by division, viz. taking off suckers, making layers
and cuttings, and budding, grafting, and inarching.</p>

<p>Propagation by <i>suckers</i> is very simple. Many
plants have a portion of their stems under ground,
from the buds in which new upright stems rise into
the air and fibrous roots descend into the ground.
It is thus only necessary to divide the horizontal
underground stem by the spade, or by opening the
ground till the stem is found, and then cutting it
through with a knife, and to take up the young
plant which has sprung from it carefully and
without injuring its roots, cutting off the remains
of the old plant before the new one is replanted.
Suckers sometimes spring from the collar of the
old plant, and when this is the case they require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
more care in removing them, to avoid injuring the
plant from which they spring.</p>

<p><i>Runners</i> are suckers proceeding from horizontal
stems above ground, and <i>offsets</i> are the suckers of
bulbs, as they proceed either from the root-plate,
which is the compressed stem of the hyacinth, or
from the main body of the corm, which is, in fact,
the stem, as in the crocus.</p>

<p><i>Layers</i> are produced by imitating the process of
nature in making suckers; as, in making layers,
a joint of the upper stem is buried in the ground,
and kept moist to induce it to throw out roots;
the buried stem being generally slit or twisted at
the joint, so as to prevent the return of the sap,
and to occasion it to expend itself in roots instead
of circulating in its ordinary way through the
branch. As soon as a layer has produced roots it
becomes the same as a sucker, and may be treated
in exactly the same manner.</p>

<p><i>Cuttings</i> are portions of a plant cut off just
below a bud, and buried in the earth to induce
them to throw out roots; which is done most
effectually by exposing them to warmth and
moisture, and shading them from the light, as
that has a tendency to draw the sap towards the
leaves, whilst warmth and bottom heat dispose
the cuttings to throw out roots. On this account
cuttings always strike most readily when the pots,
in which they are planted, are plunged into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
hotbed, and covered closely with a hand-glass.
It must be observed in making cuttings, that they
ought in most cases to consist of two buds; from
the lower one of which the new roots are to
spring, while the upper one is to produce the
stem of the new plant. Cuttings must always be
made quite firm at the base; and they generally
strike most readily when the bottom of the cutting,
which is cut through a joint and quite flat, rests
against a piece of the drainage, or even the bottom
of the pot, being in both cases pressed so closely
against its earthenware support as to exclude the
air. When a cutting is made, most of the leaves
are removed, as the evaporation from them is
greater than the plant can support while it is
without roots. Cuttings of succulent plants are
generally laid upon a shelf to dry before they are
put into the ground, as if this is not done the
wounded part is apt to become rotten, and to decay.
Cuttings are generally struck either in sand
or very light earth, in order that the young roots
may meet with as little obstruction as possible.</p>

<p><i>Pipings</i> are portions of pinks and carnations
pulled asunder at a joint instead of being divided
with a knife, and afterwards planted, and treated
exactly like cuttings.</p>

<p><i>Budding</i> is taking off a single bud or eye, called
a scion, from one plant, and inserting it in another
plant called the stock. This operation is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
performed in July or August. In the first place,
a slit is made on each side and above and below
a leaf which has a healthy bud in its axil, that is,
just between the foot-stalk of the leaf and the
branch on which it grows. The bark of the
branch containing the bud and the leaf is then
detached from the branch, by passing under it the
bone handle of the budding-knife, which is made
flat and thin on purpose, and raising it gradually
up. If the bark has been raised carefully and
properly, there will generally be a little bit of
wood just under the bud, which must be carefully
taken out, so that not the smallest particle of wood
is left on the under side of the bark. A long slit
is then made in the bark of the stock, with a cross
slit at the top, and, the bark being gently raised
at each of the corners made by the intersection of
the long slit and the horizontal slit, the piece of
bark with the bud attached is carefully introduced
under the bark of the stock, which is closed over
it, and bound tightly with a bit of bast mat, in
order that the bark containing the new bud may
be pressed as closely to the wood of the stock as
possible. If the operation has been properly
performed and the bud was a healthy one, it will
soon begin to swell; and, when it does so, it will
push off the foot-stalk of the old leaf that was
taken off with it, so that when this foot-stalk
falls it is a sign the bud has taken. When the bud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
has developed itself into leaves, the ligature should
be loosened to allow the branch of the stalk to
expand. The operation of budding requires a
good deal of nicety: first, to avoid wounding
the wood of the stock in slitting the bark; and,
secondly, to make the bark of the scion fit quite
closely to the wood of the stock, as, if the least
vacuity is left between them, the bud will wither
instead of beginning to grow.</p>

<p><i>Grafting</i> differs from budding, in the scion consisting
of several buds instead of one. It is also
performed at a different time of the year; as March
and April are the proper seasons for grafting,
whereas budding is never performed till after Midsummer.
In grafting, sometimes the head of the
stock is cut off, and sometimes only the branch,
and the scion is selected according to the size of
the part to which it is to be attached. When the
scion and the stock have been both chosen, they
are cut slantingly, so that one may fit into the
other; and care being taken that the bark and
soft wood of the two unite, at least on one side,
the two pieces are bound together, and the ligature
is covered with what is called grafting clay, that
is, a mixture of stiff clay, with a fourth part of
fresh horse-dung, and a small quantity of cut hay.
Another kind of grafting clay is composed of equal
parts of stiff clay and cow-dung. It is of very
little consequence whether the scion and the stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
are of the same diameter, provided they are so cut
and fitted, as to leave no vacuity between them,
in those parts where the union is to be effected;
and, to keep them quite closely attached to each
other, it is customary to form a tongue, or little
projecting part, by making a slanting cut in the
scion, and to make a corresponding slit in the
stock to receive it. There are several kinds of
grafting; but that which I have described, and
which is called whip or tongue grafting, is the most
common, and it is always performed with the firm
or ripened wood. There is, however, another kind
of grafting, now becoming common in the nurseries,
which is performed with the young, or unripened
wood, and this is called <i>herbaceous grafting</i>,
because the parts of the stem with which it is
performed are as succulent as the stems of herbaceous
plants. In this kind of grafting, the shoot
of the stock is broken off about two inches below
the point, and all the leaves are taken off except
two, one on each side, which are left to draw
up the sap. The stock is then split with a very
sharp knife between the leaves left on it; and, the
base of the scion having been cut into a wedge-shape,
it is fixed into the cleft made in the stock,
which is bound tightly up with strips of cerecloth,
or coarse cotton cloth covered with grafting
wax, made of equal parts of turpentine, bees' wax
and rosin, with a little tallow, melted together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Sometimes plants, especially camellias in pots, are
grafted in this manner, and placed in a hothouse
under hand-glasses, and the pot surrounded with
moss, to keep the cutting as close as possible.
This mode of grafting is of French origin, and it
is called <i>la greffe etouffée</i>.</p>

<p><i>Inarching</i> bears considerable resemblance to
layering, as it is performed without separating the
part which is to form the new plant. A branch
is bent from a living plant, and partly cut through,
and, the tongue thus formed being introduced into
a slit made in another plant, the two are bound
closely together. It is obvious that this mode of
grafting, which is called inarching, can only be
practised with plants in pots, as it requires the two
plants that are to be united to be brought close
together, and to remain so till the graft has taken
effect.</p>

<p>You must observe that, in all kinds of grafting
and budding, there must be a considerable degree
of resemblance between the scion and the stock,
for the graft to take effect. Thus, though one
stoned fruit may be grafted on another, such as
the almond or peach on the plum, a stoned fruit
cannot be grafted on a kerneled fruit, such as a
plum on an apple or a pear. In the like manner,
an apple cannot be grafted on an orange, which
was formerly supposed to be done, to produce a
pomegranate; nor a rose on a black currant, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
it was formerly believed would produce a black
rose. It is true that plants are sometimes sold
in Italy which appear to have been unnaturally
grafted, such as a rose upon an orange; but it will
be found, when closely examined, that the pith of
the orange has been artfully scooped out, and the
stem of the rose tree introduced into the hollow
space thus formed, through a hole made in the
stem close to the root. In this way the two plants
may appear to be one for some time; as the stem
of the orange tree will live and produce leaves two
or three years after the pith is removed, provided
the operation has been performed carefully.</p>

<p>The other operations of gardening are <i>pruning</i>
and <i>training</i>, and, as I have already spoken of
these when treating of the different trees, I have
only to add here that the great art in pruning is
to give a clean sloping cut without bruising the
bark, as nature will make an effort to cover the
wound if the edges of the bark are left in a
healthy state. The use of a sloping cut is, to
prevent the water from lodging on a wounded
part. Trees should never be cut in a hard frost;
and as little as possible in summer, as every
branch taken off while the plant is in a growing
state excites it to make fresh efforts to throw out
new shoots. Many persons look over their trees
in summer, and rub off all the buds which they
think likely to produce useless shoots; and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
practice, which is called disbudding, is a very
good one, as it prevents the tree from wasting its
strength unnecessarily. The principal object to
be attained in training a fruit tree is, to make the
plant produce as much fruit as possible; and for
this purpose the branches are bent backwards and
forwards to cause obstructions in the sap, as it is
only from places where there is an accumulation
of sap that flowers and fruit are produced. Another
object in training standard trees is to let the air
into the centre of the tree, so that it may ripen the
wood; and a secondary object in training trees
against a wall is, that every part of the wall may
be covered.</p>

<p>I cannot quit the subject of gardening without
saying a few words on <i>manures</i>. The object of
manuring ground is, to supply the soil with certain
properties which are necessary for the nutrition
of the plants, and this is done partly by
mixing with it some kind of animal or of vegetable
manure, and partly by adding some earth, in
which the soil of the garden may be deficient.
The new manures which have lately been so
fashionable are of both kinds: guano is the dung
of sea birds, which has been accumulating for ages
on islands off the western coasts of Africa and
South America; and nitrate of soda and Humphrey's
compound are mineral substances which
are very efficacious in promoting vegetation. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
best vegetable manure is formed from decayed
leaves, and this is a manure which may always be
used with perfect safety; whereas the others are
very injurious if used in too huge a quantity.</p>

<p>No kind of animal manure should be used in a
garden (except for making hotbeds) till it is thoroughly
decayed and all fermentation is gone off;
as while it is in process of decay the gases it
evolves are decidedly hurtful to plants. Those
manures which abound in nitrogen, such as stable
manure and the dung of birds, are the strongest
and most dangerous; as if used incautiously they
will blacken and shrivel up the leaves of the
plants to which they are applied. Guano and
pigeon's dung are very much alike in their properties,
and both are of an extremely caustic nature;
so that they should only be used in very small
quantities, or be very much diluted. One ounce
of guano to a gallon of water is a common proportion;
or the guano may be mixed with six or seven
times its own bulk of loam, peat, or charcoal, and
dug into the ground before the crops are sown: if
applied afterwards as a top dressing, it should be
either in wet weather, or the soil should be well
watered. Charcoal is very efficacious in some
cases, but it appears variable in its action; as
sometimes it produces scarcely any effect. Nitrate
of soda and saltpetre act principally by supplying
a particular kind of earth to plants that are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
want of it, and of course will not suit all plants;
but they are also of service in keeping the earth
moist, and this, when not carried to an excess, is
always useful.</p>

<p>When it is wished to keep plants constantly
in a growing state, the soil should be rendered
rich, and the plants should also be watered frequently,
so as never to suffer the soil to become
quite dry; equal care being taken to keep it free
from stagnant water, which would rot the roots.
When, however, the plant is to be hardened, to
stay out the winter, it should be kept as dry as
possible, and no manure should be applied for some
time previously to the cold weather setting in.
Nothing is less generally understood than the use
of manures. They are in fact food; and should
not be given to plants in excess, any more than
children should be crammed with food. Starving
and repletion should both be carefully avoided;
and the great art of the cultivator is shown in supplying
plants with food only when they need it.
Too much water will sometimes produce leaves
and stems instead of fruit and flowers; and shoots
of great luxuriance very frequently do not ripen,
and are killed by the first frost.</p>

<p>After telling you how to grow fruit, I must
next tell you how to keep it. A proper <i>fruit-room</i>
should be fitted up with broad shelves, or
wooden trays with rims in front to prevent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
fruit from falling off, and divided into compartments
for the different kinds. There is generally
a large table in the centre for sorting the fruits,
and a thermometer should be hung on one side to
regulate the temperature. According to Dr.
Lindley, the essential points for a fruit-room are,
"a low and steady temperature; dryness to a
certain point, for apples are found to keep best in
a rather damp atmosphere; and exclusion of the
external air:" to this he adds, that it is necessary
to keep the fruit in comparative darkness, to prevent
it from becoming shriveled and ripe prematurely;
that the temperature of the room should
not be much above 40°; and that the shelves
should be of white deal, as that wood does not give
an unpleasant taste to the fruit.</p>

<p>Fruits keep best when laid separately, so as
not to touch each other; and sometimes pears
may be kept by packing them in fern, and grapes
by packing them in jars in sawdust. Walnuts
and chestnuts should be kept in rather a moist
place, and covered with fern to exclude the air as
much as possible, as they are much injured if they
are kept too dry.</p>

<p>I may here mention that when sweet chestnuts
are sent to the table, they ought always to be
boiled first, and roasted afterwards; as, if roasted
without previously boiling, it is scarcely possible
to cook them sufficiently to make them wholesome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
without burning them. After they have been
boiled, before they are put down to roast, care
must be taken to prick the skins; as, if this is
neglected, the chestnuts will fly about in all
directions as soon as the outer skin becomes
parched.</p>

<h5>QUADRUPEDS KEPT FOR AMUSEMENT.&mdash;HORSES FOR RIDING
AND DRIVING IN PONY CARRIAGES.&mdash;MULES, ZEBRAS,
QUAGGAS, AND DONKEYS.&mdash;DOGS AND CATS.</h5>


<p>I am delighted, my dear Annie, to find that you
are fond of riding. There is something noble and
invigorating in the exercise. If your horse is
tractable and docile, you will soon begin to consider
him as your friend; and if he is refractory,
you will feel a pride in being able, by skill, to
conquer a powerful being possessing strength so
superior to your own. I like to see a lady ride
well and fearlessly; and, in short, the only drawback
I can find to the pleasure your letter gave
me is, the somewhat mysterious malady of your
horse, on which you consult me. You say that,
though a fine spirited creature when you are on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
its back, it appears dull and stupid when first
brought out, and that it shuffles against things as
if it were half-blind. You say you have consulted
a veterinary surgeon, who says that there is no
disease in the eyes, so that I suspect the evil lies
where you have probably never thought of looking
for it, viz. in the stable. If your stable is dark,
the mystery is explained at once; and I think
it is very probable that this may be the case,
as you tell me that your horse is kept in a stable
apart from the rest, that it may be taken more
care of.</p>

<p>I believe, indeed, that more of the diseases of
horses depend on the <i>stable</i> than is generally
imagined. If the stable be dark the eyes are affected;
and if it be damp the horse is liable to
catch cold; and coughs, inflammation of the lungs,
and finally broken wind, are the results. Another
evil in many cases arises from the stable that
you would not readily think of, and that is, if the
doorway is too small and the posts on each side of
it sharp-edged, the hair of the horses is frequently
injured in going in and out. Horses are, in fact,
much more delicate than is generally imagined,
and many of the diseases with which they are
afflicted arise from a want of proper attention to
their comforts. On this account, the first thing
in the management of a horse is, to see that its
stable is spacious, light, well aired, and dry. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
attending to the latter point, however, care should
be taken that it is kept dry by a drain in the
centre and at the back of the stall, and that the
paving is as nearly level as possible. It has for
some years past been the fashion to make the
pavement of stables slope so considerably towards
the door that the horse's fore-feet stand much
higher than his hind feet; and this is not only a
most uncomfortable position for a tired horse, but
it is very apt to bring on diseases in the fore-feet
and legs. It is also of great importance that the
stalls should be large enough to allow each horse
room to turn himself, and to lie down comfortably
in any position he may fancy. We all know what
a comfort it is when we are tired, to stretch ourselves
out how we like; and a hunter turned
into a loose box, after a hard day's work, will
often be found lying with his legs stretched out
like a dog, instead of having them doubled under
him as horses are obliged to sleep when confined
in narrow stalls.</p>

<p>It is a great advantage when there is a wide space
between the stalls and the door, as it prevents the
wind from blowing directly upon the horses every
time the door is opened. It is also best not to have
the stable in an exposed situation, but to have it
so placed that it may be sheltered by some other
building from the north and east winds. The
loftiness of the stable is another very important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
point. It is the custom in many places to have
the hay-loft over it; but this is bad in every
point of view, as it not only makes the ceiling of
the stable low, and by confining the air renders
the horses liable to take cold every time the door
is opened, but the dust and seeds from the hay are
apt to fall from the loft whenever the horse is
supplied with hay, and to injure him by getting
into his eyes. I am fully aware when I am saying
this, that you can neither alter the position of
your stables nor make them larger, without more
expense being incurred than your husband would
perhaps approve of. I do not, however, think
that he would object to having an additional
window made, or to adding to the height of the
stable by removing the floor of the loft, particularly
if there be any small room adjoining the
stable in which the hay can conveniently be kept.</p>

<p>A great deal, also, may be done by cleanliness.
Whenever the horse is out, the stable
should be thoroughly cleaned and the windows
opened, and whenever there is an opportunity the
rack and manger should be well cleaned and
scoured with a brush. It is, however, important
that the stable should be dry when the horse
returns to it. In some places stables are warmed
by flues or hot-water pipes, or by a fire being
kept in the harness-room adjoining; and, when
there are no means of this kind, the stable may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
kept dry by having a lamp constantly burning in
a lantern suspended from the roof. It is, indeed,
said that any stable, however damp, may be dried
with this expedient in twenty-four hours; and
that a similar lamp hung in the harness-room
will be sufficient, without fires, to keep the harness
uninjured for years. A great deal of the comfort
and health of your horses must, however, depend
on the care and attention of your grooms. Nothing
is more injurious to a horse than to be kept
standing on his litter all day. To use the words
of an exceedingly clever writer on the subject
(Sir George Stephens), "it makes the hoof brittle;
dries up the sole, and destroys its elasticity;
cankers the frog, and is a common cause of grease
and swelled legs. If, on the other hand, the
dung is regularly removed, and the dry and clean
straw carefully separated every morning, and
placed under the manger till wanted, the stable
is free from unpleasant smells, and about half the
quantity of clean straw will be consumed."</p>

<p>Horses should always be <i>cleaned</i> in the open
air, if the weather will permit; as they frequently
hurt themselves against their stalls when cleaned
in the stable, and sometimes acquire a habit of
crib-biting. Many horses have skins so fine as to
be unable to bear the use of the common curry-comb,
and these horses should be cleaned with
brushes the bristles of which are of uneven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
length. Good cleaning is a most essential point
in the management of a horse; and the horse
ought to be so clean as not to soil your hand, or
your pocket-handkerchief, if drawn over his back.
Another point to be attended to, after a horse has
had unusual work, is, to let the groom rub his legs
down well, particularly his back sinews: each leg
should be rubbed for at least ten minutes. When
horses come in warm, with their legs very dirty,
they should not be washed immediately, but they
should be rubbed dry with straw, and only some
of the dirt taken off with a dry brush. The feet
should, however, be examined, and any stones
that may be in should be picked out, and the
soles of the feet washed. A horse, when very
hot, should also not be covered with a cloth, till
he has been rubbed dry with straw. Washing
the legs of a horse with cold water, when the
horse comes in hot and dirty, is sure to give a
sudden chill; and putting on a cloth, while the
hair of a horse is wet from the effects of violent
exercise, sends the perspiration in, and is sure to
lay the foundation for disease. When a horse is
very hot, he should be rubbed for half an hour
before any cloth is put on at all; and then, if the
heat of the horse break out into moisture again,
the horse should have a second rubbing, after
which he should be covered with another quite
dry cloth. The coat of a horse generally becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
thick and shaggy in winter, and when it does so
the horse may with perfect safety be clipped, and
indeed it will be an advantage, as the hair, if
short, is much easier dried when wet, and can be
more thoroughly cleaned. Great care, however,
must be taken to protect a horse when newly
clipped from cold; and, should the weather be
severe, the horse not only ought to have an additional
cloth on in the stable, but his legs may
be bandaged with flannel rollers. The feet of a
horse should be stopped every other night with a
mixture of clay and cow-dung, and this, and
anointing the hoof with tar in hot weather, will
keep the horny part of the foot moist and elastic.
A great improvement has taken place in shoeing
horses within the last few years, by interposing a
thick piece of leather, and, in some cases, of India
rubber, between the iron shoe and the hoof of the
horse.</p>

<p>Horses should always be fed and exercised regularly.
If the hay be cut, less will be wasted; and
if the oats be bruised and mixed with cut straw,
three feeds a day will generally be sufficient instead
of four. If the servants complain of the
additional labour of bruising the oats, a mill may
be procured for that purpose, which will cost a
mere trifle, and the turning of which will afford
employment for the poor. It is seldom advisable
to give a horse that is only moderately worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
beans, but it should never be stinted in its water,
except when going out. If horses are kept short
of water, they will drink too much when they
have an opportunity; and thus often injure their
wind. When a horse is over-tired, and refuses
his corn, he will frequently take a mash of oatmeal
and water, particularly if slightly warm, and
nothing can be better for him.</p>

<p>When a horse is slightly indisposed, I would
not advise you to put him immediately into the
hands of a farrier. Most country farriers are ignorant
people, who have a certain set of recipes
which have been handed down from father to son,
and who are as far behind the present age as
Culpeper, when he recommends ointments of
certain herbs gathered under Mercury to be kept
in every house, as a sovereign remedy for all complaints,
even broken bones. It is said that horses
thrive most if they have always a lump of salt
and another of chalk in the manger. Many persons
turn a horse out to grass to cure a cough,
but this generally only makes matters worse, if
the horse has been previously kept in the stable.
When a horse has taken cold, he may frequently
be cured by stopping his corn and giving him
mashes of thin gruel and bran for a few days.
Slight feverish symptoms, which often attend a
cold, and are known by the nose feeling hot, the
eyes looking dull, and the coat rough, with loss of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
appetite, may generally be cured by similar means,
with a dose of two drachms of aloes for a horse,
and somewhat less for a pony. If these means
are not sufficient, the horse may be bled; but, if
it still continues ill, a veterinary surgeon must be
sent for. For a bruised leg or a light strain a
common bread poultice may be applied; a large
coarse stocking being drawn over the leg first,
and then the poultice put into it so as to lie on
the diseased part. Should a horse break his knees,
the part ought to be washed with warm water and
a sponge, to remove any dirt or gravel; and then
a little unsalted lard or butter should be applied,
with a little powdered alum in it if the wound be
large; and, taking care to make the hair lie as
smooth as possible, a bit of linen should be laid
on the place, and kept on with a knee-cap, not
tied too tight. If the knee be bruised as well as
cut, a poultice should be applied, and changed
two or three times a day; but on no account
use gunpowder, which is a favourite remedy for
broken knees with ignorant people, as it only
irritates the wound.</p>

<p>On no account keep a vicious horse. Do not
believe what horse-jockeys or grooms may tell you
of it being only play, or being easily cured. It is
true that horses often become vicious through the
teasing of grooms; but vice, when once shown, is
never thoroughly eradicated. Sir George Stephens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
has some excellent observations on this
subject. "A horse does not understand a jest:
tickling him or pinching him; worrying him in
the stall; sometimes coaxing and then scolding
him; dressing him when feeding; pushing him
with the fork; all play of this sort leads to retort,
which, when it becomes habitual, is incurable
vice." Other faults in horses arise from the follies
of riders. "A horse should be mounted steadily,
but promptly; and when mounted, should be allowed
to walk away quietly for the first hundred
yards: instead of this, nothing is more common
than to see a man, as soon as his foot is in the
stirrup, apply the spur and check the curb, to
show off his horse's spirit. Thus he becomes
irritable and impatient the instant he is led out
of the stable, and sometimes acquires a habit of
rearing and plunging before the rider is well
settled in his seat. Some thoughtless blockheads
can never pass a carriage (particularly if there are
ladies in it) without the same ambition of display;
and hence the animal views the approaching carriage
as a forerunner of punishment, and resists
every attempt to pass it." In harness horses frequently
acquire a habit of gibbing or swerving to
one ride from inattention to the collar; as if it
galls the shoulder, or presses on the windpipe,
which it often does when not made expressly for
the horse that wears it, "he resists the draught;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
and, when punished for resistance, he rears or
kicks; and, if he thus vanquishes a timid driver,
he will repeat the trick till it becomes habitual."
Many young men take pride in urging a horse
forward, and applying the curb at the same time
to make the horse collect himself, and <i>pioff</i> or
make the <i>coubrette</i>; or, in other words, prance
and rear. If, when the horse is in this state, the
right rein be pressed, the horse will <i>passage</i>, that
is, cross his legs, and go sideways to the right,
with his head bending towards the right; but if
the left rein be pressed also, though not quite so
strongly as the right, the horse will perform the
manœuvre called the <i>épaule en dedans</i>, and will go
sideways to the left, bending and looking towards
the right. But without going through all the
terms of the <i>manège</i>, I may observe that most
riding-masters advise their pupils to make the
horse feel the rein; and this, which is called the
bearing or <i>appui</i>, is of the utmost consequence in
good horsemanship. There should indeed be a
proper understanding, if I may use the term, between
the horse's mouth and the rider's hand, so
as to make the horse obey the slightest indication
from the rein. All the movements of guidance
in a good rider should indeed be so slight and
gentle as to be almost imperceptible, there should
be nothing approaching to jerking or pulling; but
the horse should seem instinctively to obey the
rider's will. It is a very good plan to accustom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
your horse to your voice, and to pat or caress him
and give him occasionally an apple, a piece of
bread or a carrot, speaking kindly to him at the
same time. Horses may indeed be taught as
many tricks as dogs, and sometimes more. I have
known several instances of shooting ponies learning
to open gates; and I have heard of others who
have been taught to pick up a handkerchief, a
glove, or even a whip, in their mouths, and to
turn their heads round with it, so as to give it to
their rider.</p>

<p>Whenever you ride out, take care that your
hair is combed smoothly off your face, and firmly
twisted up behind; your hat should also fit properly,
and be tied firmly under your chin, not
merely for the comfort it will give you, but because,
if either your hair or your hat should feel
loose, and you should put up your hand to arrange
them, you might touch the horse with your whip,
or slacken your hold of the reins in such a manner
as to expose yourself to the greatest danger.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible to give directions for holding
the reins properly by words; as you would
learn better in five minutes by being shown, than
from a volume of descriptions. I may, however,
advise you to take care to sit in the centre of your
saddle, and not to hang by the left crutel of your
pommel. You should also take care to keep your
body erect, or slightly leaning backwards; as, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
you allow yourself to lean forwards, you will not
only have an awkward air, but be in danger of
making your horse stumble, by your weight being
thrown too much upon its shoulders. The reins
look best when held only in the left hand, while
the whip is held in the right, care being taken to
carry it in such a manner as not to irritate the
flank of the horse.</p>

<p>In modern side-saddles, the right-hand crutel
of the pommel is made very small; but there is a
third crutel added behind, nominally for assistance
in leaping, but which is very useful in enabling a
lady to keep her proper position in the saddle.
The stirrup is now considered of little use, except
to support the left foot, and many of the best
riding-masters make their pupils ride without one,
and to put their arms behind them, while the
master holds the longe and urges the horse to his
speed. When a lady can do this she has learned
the art of riding, and will be able to rise and fall
with her horse without any apparent exertion, and
as if the fable of the Centaur were realised, and
the horse and his rider had become one body.</p>

<p>The preserving of a proper balance is the most
difficult part of horsemanship, and it must be attended
to in every movement that is given to the
horse, in accordance with the laws of motion in
mechanics. Thus, when the horse is urged forward,
the body should lean forwards likewise; and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
the horse is checked, the body should be bent
backwards. A lady is said to have a good seat
when she can see the right shoe of her horse in all
his paces, by only bending slightly forwards; and
when she has a good seat, particularly if she be
courageous and have presence of mind, she will
not easily be thrown. It is, however, proper to
know what to do in cases of emergency. When
a horse rears, the rider should loosen the rein, and
press the weight of her body forward; and when
a horse kicks, she should hold her body back and
keep a tight rein. When a horse will keep turning
round several times, he may generally be
checked by pulling his head in the opposite direction
to that in which he wants to turn; and,
when a horse runs away, the best way is not to
attempt to pull him in, but for the rider to direct
all her energies to keeping her horse in the right
course, and retaining her seat. When a horse
shies it is from fear, and he should be patted
and encouraged; and, when a horse stumbles,
his rider should raise and support him by pulling
in his head, and at the same time throwing her
body back.</p>

<p>I do not know whether you have a <i>pony-carriage</i>;
but, if you have not, I would advise
you to get one, as you would find it very useful
in summer to drive round your park, and to pay
visits to your neighbours. In a close carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
you see very little of the scenery, and enjoy but
little benefit from the air; whereas, in an open
carriage, you have more enjoyment of the beauty
of the country than even in walking; and you
have every advantage from the air without running
so much risk of taking cold, as you would
do if you were to open the windows of a close
carriage. <i>Àpropos</i> to this, I have often wondered
that no better means have yet been contrived of
ventilating a close carriage than opening the windows,
the draught from which is sure to give cold
to some one. Surely a ventilator might be fixed
in the roof, and a little shutter contrived to slide
below it, when it was not wanted, which might
be moved by a string inside the carriage. I have
lately seen, in the <i>coupé</i> of a French diligence in
the South of France, a little opening just above
the windows, which was filled in with double <i>toile
métallique</i>, or wire cloth, so very fine as to admit
but little light, and no perceptible air, and which
was yet sufficient to prevent the glass from becoming
covered with steam when all the windows
were closed; and something of the kind might, I
think, be generally adopted.</p>

<p>But to return to your pony-carriage. If you
buy one, take especial care that it "runs light;"
as it is not only a relief to the feelings to know
that your horses have as light a weight to draw as
possible, but you will find the motion of such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
carriage infinitely more agreeable than that of one
which is dragged along with difficulty. Besides,
a pony-carriage that is intended only to carry a
light weight, and to run over smooth turf or a
good road, need not be built so strongly as a travelling
carriage, which is to convey luggage as
well as passengers, and which will be exposed to
all the rough treatment it is likely to meet with
at inns, as well as the shaking it will probably
undergo from the different kinds of roads to be
driven over. It is curious enough, however, that
a carriage is rarely so much hurt by passing over
pavement, however much it appears to shake, as it
is by passing over bad roads, the surface of which
is uneven, and by which the springs and braces
are strained unequally. The French postilions are
so well aware of this, that they always prefer
rattling their carriages over the <i>pavé</i>, to driving
on the side roads, however smooth and inviting
they may look. In ancient times we are
told the ladies had rods, called <i>pomelles</i>, fixed
in the roofs of their carriages, with a knob at the
end to hold by, in order to steady themselves
when the carriage was jerked about by the deep
ruts in the roads. This was, I believe, about the
time of Chaucer; and though we retain remnants
of the custom in the lace-holders of carriages in
modern days, our carriages are now too well hung
to render anything of the kind really necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>You are perhaps not aware that a carriage is
hung exactly on the same principle as a hammock
is suspended in a ship at sea, viz. to substitute a
gentle and regular swinging motion for an irregular
jerking one. The principle of suspending
carriages is as old as the time of the Saxons; but
it has been reserved for modern days to break the
force of inevitable jolts, by such a variety of pieces
of elastic steel or springs, as to render travelling
in a carriage as easy as gliding in a boat down a
smooth river. Carriages, such as those we have
now in use, are, as no doubt you know, quite a
recent invention. You remember the celebrated
letter of Henry IV., in which he says, "I cannot
come to you to-day, because my wife is using
my coach;" and even in the time of Charles II.
there were but fifty coaches in London and Westminster.
Now it would be rather difficult to
count them, and it would even be a more tedious
task than I should like to undertake, to enumerate
their kinds. I shall, therefore, content myself
with mentioning the points that are of most importance
in selecting a carriage.</p>

<p>The first thing to be examined is, whether
it possesses proper elasticity; and this is generally
tried by having the carriage shaken on its
springs, and observing whether it appears rigid
or yielding to the vibrations of the motion. All
carriages ought to be built of ash, which is at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
once the most elastic and the toughest of our
English woods; but, as it is rather expensive,
cheaper woods are sometimes substituted. It is
also known that the narrower the tread of a carriage
is, that is, the shorter the axle-trees are, the
easier will be the draught. The springs should
then be examined, as the carriage runs lighter
and is easier when the plates of the springs are
of equal thickness, though the largest plate is
frequently made much thicker than the rest.
The stuffing of the carriage ought also to be
examined, as, if the material with which it is
stuffed be not left sufficiently loose to be elastic, a
stuffed carriage will be nearly as hard and as uncomfortable
to ride in as a carriage which was
formed only of bare boards; and care should be
taken that the seats are made sufficiently wide and
low, and far enough apart not to cramp the legs.</p>

<p>It is a great point, as regards the appearance of
a carriage, that the horses should be suited to it.
The most elegant little carriage in the world
would look ridiculous if drawn by a pair of heavy
cart-horses; and when a very heavy-looking carriage
is drawn by ponies, or very light blood-horses,
the unpleasant impression produced by
the incongruity is increased by a feeling of pain
at seeing such noble creatures as horses subjected
to labour unsuited for them.</p>

<p>Some persons use <i>mules</i> for drawing carriages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
and they have the advantage of being sure-footed,
besides which they are, I believe, much stronger,
in proportion to their size, than horses. They,
however, partake largely of the bad qualities derived
from their asinine parentage, and are sometimes
extremely obstinate and difficult to manage.</p>

<p>The <i>quagga</i> and the <i>zebra</i> are other animals of
the ass kind, which are sometimes kept in parks
for their beauty, and occasionally driven in carriages.
However, as those who know them best
say that they are generally wicked, treacherous,
obstinate, and fickle in their disposition, I think
the less a lady has to do with them the better.</p>

<p>After saying so much with regard to animals
used for riding and drawing, I must not omit to
mention <i>asses</i>. Most persons residing in the
country keep one or two of these useful animals,
in order that they may be ready to do any kind
of work that their proud rival, the horse, is unfit
for. It is scarcely possible to imagine two animals
bearing considerable resemblance to each other in
form, more unlike in character and constitution.
The horse, as an able writer on the subject says,
"is proud, fiery, and impetuous; nice in his taste;
and delicate in his constitution. The ass, on the
contrary, is humble, patient, and contented with
scanty and coarse food, which other cattle reject.
He bears, with patience and fortitude, the most
cruel treatment: yet he is more susceptible of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
strong attachment than the horse; has, apparently,
more prudence and reflection; and is capable
of a degree of education which would not
be anticipated from the forlorn and dejected appearance
which coarse food and harsh treatment
have rendered habitual to him."</p>

<p>I think you told me in your first letter that
you were very much struck with the kindness of
your husband, who, having recollected that you
had been accustomed to take asses' milk, had
provided a she-ass for you. Now, if that she-ass
has a foal, let me recommend you to try
what can be done to improve it by good food and
kind treatment. I do not mean that it should
have three or four regular feeds of corn every
day, like a horse; but if it is fed twice or thrice
a day on cut hay and straw, mixed with a very
few bruised oats, it will soon grow large and
strong, and will display a degree of liveliness and
spirit that those who only know asses in their
degraded state would scarcely believe possible.</p>

<p>Though asses are proverbially hardy, warmth
seems congenial to them, and it is a well-known
fact, that in Persia and Arabia asses are noble
and high-spirited creatures, fetching a higher
price than horses, and generally preferred to them
for the saddle. Even in Spain, they are frequently
fifteen hands high, that is, as large as a
good-sized horse; while in the north they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
small, and by no means common. Till lately
they were very seldom seen in either Scotland
or Sweden, and they are unknown in Norway.</p>

<p>If you bring up your little donkey as I have
advised, I think you will find it advantageous to
have it regularly cleaned like a horse, and you
need not be afraid of your groom hurting it with
the curry-comb, as the skin of the ass is remarkably
thick. It must, however, be broken in and
regularly trained before you venture to ride it, as
you will find it full of spirit. The usual age for
breaking donkeys in is about three years, but, as
yours will be rather precocious, I think you may
begin when it is about two years old. Asses
and mules are admirably adapted for mountainous
countries, as their hoofs are long, and furnished
with very sharp rims, leaving a hollow in the
centre like the ring of a patten. The hoof of
the horse, on the contrary, is round and nearly
flat underneath.</p>

<p>It is the peculiar formation of the foot that
renders mules so valuable in Spain, where there
are so many mountain ridges to be climbed over;
and I have been told that in Spain sixty guineas
English is by no means an uncommon price to
be given for a good mule. You must not form
any idea of what your donkey will be from the
specimens you have seen at watering places; for
no doubt you remember what the Irishman said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
of a Ramsgate donkey&mdash;"that it was the hardest-worked
creature in the universe; for it was carrying
angels all the day, and spirits all the night."
Your donkey, on the contrary, will spurn the
ground beneath him; and I expect, when I come
to see you, to find you cantering over the downs
upon it with your little dog Fair Star running
by your side.</p>

<p>Haying mentioned your pretty little spaniel
reminds me that I promised to give you some
hints on <i>dog management</i>, and I think I cannot
make a more useful conclusion to my letter.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is generally allowed by
the learned in such matters, that whenever a dog
becomes very fat, which lap-dogs are very apt to
do, it is sure to have that distressing disease called
the <i>canine asthma</i>. How many poor dogs have I
heard wheezing and panting with this complaint,
and how earnestly have I longed to become their
doctor! When the disease is of moderate standing,
very frequently a little abstinence, and feeding
regularly, but only at stated times, will give relief;
but, if this is not enough, one grain of tartar
emetic with two, three, or four grains of calomel,
according to the size of the dog, will effect a cure.</p>

<p><i>Sore eyes</i> are for the most part produced by
some derangement of the stomach; and, for their
cure, putting a stick of sulphur in some water
within reach of the dog will generally be sufficient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
The water should be changed every day, but the
same piece of sulphur will do for months.</p>

<p>Almost all young dogs are liable to the
<i>distemper</i>, and it kills many. When seized with
it before they are eighteen months old they generally
die, but after that age it is much less
likely to prove fatal. Most dog-doctors give a
dose of tartar emetic and calomel, like that I have
mentioned above, if they are called in while the
disease is in its first stage; but, when it is attended
with a kind of dysentery, they give balls
made of prepared chalk, gum arabic, and conserve
of roses, and the dog is fed on rice-milk. The
best cure however is, I believe, a powder sold in
the chemists' shops compounded especially for this
disease; and you must observe, whatever means
of cure may be adopted, it is essential during the
whole progress of the complaint that the dog
should be kept warm and well fed.</p>

<p>When dogs have <i>fits</i> they may generally be
cured by throwing cold water over them, and
<i>inflammation of the lungs</i> requires bleeding.</p>

<p><i>Inflammation of the bowels</i> is generally incurable,
as is likewise <i>canine madness</i>; and in the
latter case, of course, the dog should be killed as
soon as possible. Should, however, any human
being or any animal be bitten, the following
remedy has been recommended to me by a highly
valued friend, who had it from an eminent French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
surgeon. It is simply to mix two table-spoonfuls
of fresh chloride of lime, in powder, with half a
pint of water, and with this keep continually
washing the wound. The chlorine evolved by
this process is said to possess the power of decomposing
the virus; but I hope and trust you
may never have occasion to try its efficacy. Chloride
of lime is, you know, wonderfully efficacious
in preventing infection, and in dispelling noxious
gases.</p>

<p>As I am partial to <i>cats</i>, I cannot resist saying
a few words respecting them. Though originally
the natives of warm climates, they are generally
much more hardy than dogs. They like warmth,
however, and are very powerfully affected by
changes in the weather. You are, perhaps, not
aware that there are four distinct races of cats;
viz., the tabby, which includes the black cats, and
which is nearest allied to the wild kinds; the
tortoise-shell cat, which came originally from
Spain, and the males of which are buff, with
stripes of a darker hue; the white and light-coloured
cats, which have reddish eyes and a greyish
tint in their fur, and are descended from the
Chartreuse breed; and the Angora cats, which are
quite distinct from all the others, and are known
by their long fur. The tailless cats of Cornwall
and the Isle of Man belong to the Chartreuse
breed, and they are the ugliest of their kind, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
the Angora cats are the handsomest. Cats are
seldom ill, except from cold, which generally gets
well without any particular care being taken of
it; but when they have any serious disease it
generally proves fatal.</p>

<h4><a name="LETTER_XIV" id="LETTER_XIV">LETTER XIV.</a></h4>

<h5>QUADRUPEDS KEPT FOR SUPPLYING FOOD.&mdash;COWS, CALVES,
GOATS, PIGS, RABBITS, AND DEER.</h5>


<p>I am very glad, my dear Annie, to hear such
favourable accounts of your garden, and to find,
by the inquiries you are beginning to make, that
you really are taking a lively interest in country
affairs. You say you are getting quite fond of
your dairy; but that you cannot understand how
it is that your cows produce so much less milk in
the morning than they do at night, when there
are exactly twelve hours between the milkings in
both cases; as they are milked first at five in the
morning, and again at five in the afternoon. I
have no doubt from what you say, that your cows
are kept in the cow-house during the night, and
only turned out during the day, as this would
account for the difference in the quantity of milk.
But such a mode of management, though it saves
trouble to the dairy-maid, who finds it much
easier to milk the cows in the cow-house than in
the open field, is bad for both the cows and the
dairy; as the cows, after feeding on grass all day,
cannot of course relish dry food at night, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
whenever they fast unnaturally very little milk is
secreted.</p>

<p>Your dairy-maid will probably tell you that
cows are very delicate, and that they will catch
cold if they sleep in the open air; but from May
till September, unless the weather be particularly
cold and rainy, they are less liable to take cold
if they sleep in the open air than if they are
kept in a warm cow-house all night, and turned
out about sunrise. Cows are peculiarly sensible
of all sudden changes of temperature, especially
from heat to cold; and, after they have been kept
in a cow-house all the winter, great care should be
taken to accustom them gradually to the change
when they are first turned out to grass, by letting
them out only for a few hours in the middle of
the day; but when they are become accustomed
to the open air, and the nights are warm, they
are much better kept in the open air altogether,
especially if there is a shed in the field, under
which they can find a dry place to lie upon if it
should rain.</p>

<p>The following observations on this subject are
from an excellent work, entitled <i>The Book of
the Farm</i>, published in 1844:&mdash;"This mode of
allowing them to lie out always in a sheltered
field, no doubt, imposes a good deal of labour on
the dairy-maid and her assistant, in carrying the
milk to the dairy after the calves have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
weaned, but I am persuaded it is an excellent
system for the health of the cows. Under it,
cows rise from their lair at daybreak, and feed
while the dew is on the grass; and by the time
when the hour of milking arrives, say six o'clock,
they are already partially filled with food, and
stand contented, chewing the cud, while the milking
proceeds. They then rove about, and fill
themselves, and by nine o'clock they lie down
in a shady part of the field, and chew their
cud until milking-time arrives at mid-day; after
which they again roam about for food, and,
when the afternoon is hot, will stand in the
coolest part of the field, whisking away the flies
with their tails and ears. The evening milking
takes place about seven, after which they feed
industriously, and take up their lair about sunset,
from which they rouse themselves in the morning
before being milked. Some people are apprehensive
that cows must injure themselves by
eating grass which is wet with dew in the morning;
but it is a fact, which I believe is not so
sufficiently known as it should be, that bedewed
grass before sunrise, and grass after it is dried by
the sun, are alike wholesome for animals; and it
is only when the dew is in the act of being evaporated,
immediately after sunrise, that grass
proves injurious to them. Why it should be injurious
at that particular state I do not precisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
know, but I imagine it to be so, because the grass
then becomes suddenly cold by the evaporation of
the dew. When cows lie out, they have nearly
filled themselves by the time the dew is evaporated,
and therefore feel less inclined to eat the grass
while in the dangerous state; whereas cows that
are housed all night are usually milked about sunrise,
and put out to grass just at the very time
the dew on it is being evaporated, and is, of course,
in the most dangerous state, just when the cows
feel the greatest hunger, and eat most grass."</p>

<p>When cows eat a quantity of grass in this state,
they very often have the disease which is called
<i>hoven</i> or <i>blown</i>. To make you understand this
fearful complaint, I must remind you that cows,
in common with all ruminating animals, have four
stomachs; and that, when a cow is turned into a
field, she twists her tongue round mouthful after
mouthful of the long grass, and after biting each
off, conveys it without chewing to her first stomach
or paunch, till this is about half full, when
the animal seems stimulated by nature to seek
rest and quiet, for she leaves off eating, and either
stands perfectly still in some shady place, or lies
down. The paunch now begins to exert its extraordinary
power of separating a small portion of
the food it contains, and returning it to the mouth,
when the animal begins slowly to masticate it,
moistening it as she does so with small quantities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
of water which she draws up from time to time
from her second stomach, or honeycomb, in which
water is retained for that purpose; and this operation
is called chewing the cud. The food, when
thoroughly masticated, is conveyed by another
channel to the third stomach or many-plies, where
it is subjected to muscular action; and, finally, it
is conveyed into the fourth stomach, or red bag,
which contains the gastric juice, and which in
calves is the part used for rennet; and here the
process of digestion is completed. Sheep, goats,
deer, and camels are all ruminating animals, and
are, of course, all furnished with the same apparatus
for digestion; but in sheep the paunch is
smaller, as they bite close to the ground, and take
smaller mouthfuls than cattle; and in camels the
second stomach, or receptacle for water, is much
larger.</p>

<p>Whenever ruminating animals are particularly
hungry, or are excited by any other cause to eat
too much food, they fill the paunch so full that it
is unable to exert its power of separating the food
it contains into small portions for mastication, and,
the whole mass beginning to ferment in the paunch,
gases are generated, which distend the paunch till
it bursts, and the unfortunate animal is suffocated,
unless it is relieved by puncturing the paunch
through the hide, or by forcing an instrument
called a probang down the throat into the paunch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
and thus opening a passage for the gases to
escape. A probang is a piece of whalebone with
a bit of sponge firmly fixed to one end; but, if
one is not at hand, a cane with a knot at the end,
or even a riding-whip, with a thick end, would
probably suffice. The best instrument is a kind
of stomach pump; but that, of course, can only
be had from a cattle doctor. When the paunch
is to be punctured, the animal must be stabbed
with a knife (a penknife will do) midway between
the haunch-bone and the last rib of the left side;
and the opening should be prevented from closing,
by the introduction of a tin tube or something of
that kind, till the gases are dispelled. In the
South of France a proper instrument is kept for
this purpose, made something like an oyster-knife,
with a guard to prevent it from going too deeply
into the animal. As soon as the animal is relieved
a strong stimulant should be administered, such as
half a pint of gin, or an ounce of hartshorn in a
pint of ale; but the animal for some days should
be fed sparingly, and a tonic composed of gentian,
aloes, ginger, and blue vitriol, in powder, each one
drachm, and oak bark in powder six drachms,
made into a ball with honey, may be given every
morning.</p>

<p>As I have begun to speak of the diseases of
cows, I may add that in cases of <i>cold</i> and slight
feverish symptoms, they are generally relieved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
giving them half an ounce of nitre in a mash every
night. Where there are any symptoms of inflammation,
as, for example, if the nose is very red and
hot and dry, and the cow appears very thirsty,
and has her body so hard that she seems to suffer
pain when it is touched, she may be bled, and a
saline draught, composed of eight ounces of Epsom
salts and four ounces of castor oil may be administered;
or, if a stronger dose seems requisite, to
these may be added half an ounce of powdered
aloes, beaten up with the yolk of an egg, and
mixed gradually with eight ounces of water.</p>

<p>In <i>diarrhœa</i>, or <i>dysentery</i>, give four ounces of
suet boiled in eight ounces of skim-milk, with six
ounces of starch dissolved in boiling water, and
one drachm of powdered alum; and keep the
animal in a warm dry place, giving it mashes of
barley meal or buck-wheat, but not of malt, and
only a little water, which should be warm.</p>

<p>If the cow be affected with the <i>yellows</i>, which
is known by the nostrils and eyelids looking
yellow, ten grains of calomel should be given
every other night, and a saline dose once a week,
the animal being kept warm, and only turned out
in the middle of the day, in a fresh pasture, if
practicable.</p>

<p>Loss of appetite may be relieved by tonics.</p>

<p>All other diseases of cattle (and they are numerous)
are too serious to be tampered with, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
should be referred to a good cattle doctor at
once.</p>

<p>Many persons say a great deal of the <i>kinds</i> of
cows that are to be preferred; but this I think of
very little consequence, as there are good and bad
milkers of every breed. Generally speakings
small, neat, compact-looking cows, are best suited
for a gentleman's demesne, as they look better in
the landscape, and do not tread up the ground so
much as large heavy cattle. Alderney cows are
much admired for the elegance of their forms and
the richness of their milk; but they are delicate,
and are subject to colds and loss of appetite. The
Ayrshire cows are quite as handsome, and both
better milkers and much hardier; but they are
not often to be met with in England.</p>

<p>Whatever kind you select, a great deal depends
upon their management. They are delicate in
their appetites, and do not like grass that they
have trodden down and breathed upon for many
days; and they require rather long grass, because
they always wrap the grass round with the
tongue before they bite it, instead of nibbling the
grass with their lips, and biting close to the
ground, as is done by sheep and horses. For
these reasons cows require to have their pasture
changed every fortnight if practicable; and, when
they are removed from a field, a man should be
employed to toss their manure about so as to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
it from lying in patches, as, unless this is
done, coarse strong grass, which no cow will eat,
will spring up from every place where a patch of
cow-dung has lain. If, however, the field be
properly treated, the cow may be brought back
to it in about a fortnight, or at most in three or
four weeks.</p>

<p>Cows are very particular in having clean
water, though they do not drink often, as the
second stomach serves as a reservoir; and where
there is a pond they generally go into it till they
come to deep water before they drink; and this
habit is good for their feet. There should also be
either an open shed, or at least one large tree, in
the field, to afford shade for the cows while they
are chewing the cud; and they should never be
changed suddenly from a very poor pasture to a
very rich one, or the reverse.</p>

<p>When cows are first taken up from grass in
autumn, they should be fed on cut grass, mixed
occasionally with a few carrots; and they should
be turned out in the daytime, but not till after
nine or ten o'clock in the morning, and taken up
before the dew falls at night. By degrees hay
should be mingled with their food, and the quantity
of this should be gradually increased while
that of the grass is diminished; some carrots cut
in tolerably thick slices and a few grains being
given occasionally, till the cows have become accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
to their dry food. There are few points
in the management of cows of greater difficulty
than that of enabling them to bear the transition
from grass to dry food without losing their flesh,
or the quantity of their milk being diminished.
The one is, indeed, generally dependent on the
other, as no cow will yield a proper quantity of
milk unless she is in good condition; and many
cows refuse their food altogether when they are
first taken up for the winter, as they none of
them like dry food so well as grass. It is on this
account that many farmers give their cows turnips
when they are first taken up from grass; but all
succulent roots and vegetables, except carrots and
boiled potatoes, give an unpleasant flavour to the
milk; so that they ought never to be used in private
families, where, of course, it is of more importance
to have the butter good than to have a
large quantity of it.</p>

<p>Many persons milk their cows in summer three
times a day, and I believe this to be a very good
plan, where it is an object to get as much milk as
possible, as there is no doubt that frequent milking
increases the quantity of milk secreted by the
animal. As, however, I have frequently heard
that the milk is poorer under this management, in
most cases I should think it hardly worth the
trouble. It is, however, a very good plan to
make the dairy-maid take a little can of warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
water with her when she goes to the field, and to
make her wash the udders and teats of the cows
well with a sponge before she begins to milk.
This is not only a cleanly practice, but it is agreeable
to the cow, and makes her part with her milk
more readily. After the dairy-maid has milked all
the cows, she should begin with the first, and milk
them all over again, as the milk produced by this
second milking, which is called the drippings, is
always richer than the rest; and besides, if it
is left in the udder, the cow will gradually become
dry.</p>

<p>There are many opinions about the length
of time that a cow should be suffered to be dry
before calving; some farmers advising the cows
to be let dry two months, and others milking them
till within a fortnight of the time of calving. As
far as my own experience goes, the latter plan is
the best, as I have observed that, when cows have
been dry a long time, they are very subject to inflammation
in the udder when they are again
milked, instead of the contrary being the case, as
is commonly supposed. When a cow is to be let
dry, a little milk is left in the udder every time of
milking, and in about a week or ten days the
secretion of milk will cease.</p>

<p>The first milk after calving is called biestings,
and is so very different in quality from the other
milk, that it should not be mixed with it. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
of a yellow colour and a glutinous nature, and,
though it is used in some places for making puddings
and custards without eggs, it ought always
to be reserved for the calf, to whose use nature
has especially assigned it. When calves are allowed
to suck their mothers' milk for the first four
or five days after they are calved, they have seldom
any thing the matter with them; but, when they
are fed with the milk of other cows, they generally
require castor oil and other medicines.</p>

<p>Calves, when they are to be reared, are generally
fed principally on milk for the first thirteen weeks,
after which they are fed partly with hay tea,
which the dairy-maids make them suck through
their fingers, till they are old enough to eat grass;
but the rearing of calves is rather too difficult a
task for you to undertake from any directions
that I could give you; and, as for the management
of those poor calves which are to be fattened
and then sold to the butcher, I am sure you would
not wish to know any thing about it.</p>

<p>Some people are very partial to goat's milk, as
it is remarkably rich and sweet; but <i>goats</i> are
rather troublesome creatures. In the first place,
the female goats are very capricious, and will not
only seldom permit a stranger to milk them, but
will often refuse to give down their milk even
to those to whom they are accustomed. They
are also very troublesome from their being much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
more partial to branches of trees than grass; and
if they can ever contrive to get into a shrubbery,
which they will do if possible, they will destroy
nearly all the shrubs in an incredibly short space
of time. Besides this, some goats are very fond
of butting at children or any persons who may
appear weak and delicate; and, even though they
may not be able to do any serious mischief, they
may cause considerable alarm. Many persons are
very fond of the flesh of kids, but it is more eaten
abroad than in England. When goats are kept,
they do best in flocks, and they should have access
to shelter, both in winter and summer, extremes
of heat and cold being alike prejudicial to them;
and the house in which they are kept should have
a paved floor, and no litter.</p>

<p>Wherever there are cows and a garden, <i>pigs</i>
should be kept; as skim-milk and buttermilk, with
the refuse of a garden, are almost sufficient to
maintain a pig. Pigs are unlike most other animals,
as they fatten soonest on sour food; they
should, however, be kept clean, and in many
places, I am told, the cottagers rub them with a
broom. Sows are very apt to destroy their young
when they are littered with long straw, as the pigs
sometimes hide themselves in it for warmth, and
are trodden upon accidentally or smothered by
their mother. A sow ought, therefore, to be
littered with short straw when she is expected to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
produce young. Pigs are greedy creatures, and,
when there are several together, the master pig
generally puts his foot in the trough while feeding,
so as to prevent any other pig coming near him
till he has done.</p>

<p>Young pigs are generally weaned when they
are six or seven weeks old; and, when they
are killed at this age or sooner, they are termed
sucking-pigs, and are generally roasted whole.
After they are taken from their mother they are
generally fed three times a day on a food composed
of the washing of dishes, skim-milk, buttermilk,
whey, potatoes, grains, cabbage leaves,
pea-shells, and any refuse from the garden. While
pigs are growing they should be allowed as much
liberty as they can have without doing injury; but
pigs are very troublesome creatures to turn into
a field, as they will dig up the roots of the grass
wherever they can with their noses, and on this
account young pigs are frequently ringed; that is,
a slender iron ring is passed through the cartilage
of the nose, or the cartilage itself is slit open with
a knife. When they are about five or six months
old they will have attained their full growth; and,
if they are intended to be killed and eaten for
pork, they are put up in a sty, and fed with
boiled potatoes, milk, and a little barley meal.</p>

<p>When a pig is intended for bacon, he is called a
store-pig till he is about eight months old, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
he is put up to be fed, and is fattened on peas,
meal, potatoes, and milk, always adding a sack or
two of ground oats, or crushed barley, a short
time before he is killed, to make the fat firm.
Opinions differ very much as to what kind of pig
should be preferred, but those are generally considered
the best which have large deep bodies,
short legs, and small heads.</p>

<p><i>Rabbits</i> are kept either in hutches or in warrens,
where they make burrows in the ground, and live
almost in a state of nature. Rabbit warrens are
of very great extent, varying from a hundred to
three thousand acres, and they can only be formed
in dry sandy soils. When rabbits are kept in
hutches, the rabbit-house should be particularly
dry and well ventilated, as rabbits are very subject
to a disease called the rot, which is a species
of liver complaint, brought on by impure air
and improper food. Each hutch is generally
eighteen inches high, and about three feet wide.
It is divided into two chambers, in one of which
the rabbit feeds, sleeping in the other. These
chambers have a sliding-door between them, so
that when the rabbit is in one chamber, the door
can be let down, and the other chamber cleared
out.</p>

<p>Rabbits should be fed in a great measure on
corn, peas, and bran; and their food may be
diversified by carrots, cooked potatoes, tares, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
a few cabbage leaves; but these last should be
fresh, and never in the slightest degree decayed.
Lettuces and other green food may also be occasionally
given, provided they are quite fresh,
and that what the rabbit does not eat is removed
as soon as it has done feeding. Rabbits should
be fed twice or three times a day, and, if to be
fattened for the table, they are considered best
when about three or four months old. They are
liable to many diseases, most of which are incurable.
Some, however, may be stopped in time,
if, whenever the rabbits appear too large in the
body, their food is changed, and instead of being
fed on green meat, they are given nothing but
cut hay and corn, and ground peas, or some
similar food.</p>

<p>I shall say nothing of the management of <i>sheep</i>,
as they certainly do not come within a lady's
province. Their constitutions are very much like
those of rabbits, and they are subject to nearly
the same diseases.</p>

<p>The kind of deer most common in parks is the
<i>fallow deer</i>. These creatures are generally beautifully
spotted, and the horns of the buck are
broad and flat. They are changed every year,
being at first shaped like a finger, and not much
larger, but they afterwards become branched,
and continue increasing rapidly in size, and in
the number of their branches, till the buck is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
five years old; they afterwards increase more
slowly, but they continue changing in form for
several years. The does are exceedingly tame,
and may be easily taught to come and feed out of
the hand, while the fawns are the prettiest little
creatures imaginable.</p>

<p>The word fallow is said to be derived from an
ancient Saxon word signifying to become pale, in
allusion to the manner in which the colour of the
fallow deer is shaded down from the deep streak
of dark brown on the back, to the pale fawn of
the sides and the white under the body. There
are several varieties, but the differences consist
chiefly in the shades of colour. The buck of the
fallow deer may be killed from the middle of June
to the middle of September; and its venison,
which is considered much finer than that of the
doe, is in perfection when the buck is from six to
eight years old. Does may be killed younger;
and if they have had no fawns, or have been soon
deprived of them, they are in season from the
middle of November to the middle of February.</p>

<p>Deers are ruminating animals, and, after they
have filled the first stomach, they go under the
shade of trees to chew the cud. When snow is
on the ground fallow deer are generally fed; as,
if they are not, they are apt to do a great deal of
mischief to the trees in the park, by tearing down
the branches. When they are fed it is with cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
hay and straw, mixed with young shoots of underwood.</p>

<p>When fallow deer are to be shot, the keeper
generally gets into a kind of hut, so contrived as
to have a loophole in the back for the rifle, and
to watch through, so that, when the herd passes by,
the keeper may remain unseen by the deer, and
close enough to the herd to select and shoot the
one most suited to his purpose. These huts have
seats inside, and are convenient spots for observing
the habits of birds and other creatures in a
wild state, which would not, under other circumstances,
suffer human beings to approach them.
It is, however, only in parks that have been long
used for keeping deer, that these huts are to be
found, as modern gamekeepers generally consider
themselves sufficiently expert to select and shoot
their deer without any protection. In old parks,
likewise, strips of boards are frequently found
nailed to the trunks of trees to enable the keepers
to ascend them for the purpose of shooting the
deer; and advantage is taken of rocky scenery
to make caves for the same purpose. The keepers
were also attended by a bloodhound to chase any
unfortunate deer that might be wounded without
being killed; but this is now also found unnecessary,
as the herd drive a wounded deer from
them the moment it has been struck, and the only
use of the keeper's dog is to follow the deer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
case it should take to thick underwood and lie
down there to die.</p>

<p>There are two other distinct species of deer,
viz. the red deer and the roe; but they are now
seldom kept in parks in England. The <i>red deer</i>
is abundant in Scotland, and hunting it and
shooting it with a rifle, which last is called deer-stalking,
are two favourite sports with the Scotch
landed proprietors. The male of the red deer is
called a stag, the female a hind, and the young a
calf. The stag, when young, is sometimes called
a brocket, and when it is more than six years old
it is called a hart, and, if it belongs to a royal
chase, a hart-royal. It stands about four feet
high from the shoulder, and one has been known
to weigh upwards of thirty stone when killed.
The <i>roe</i> is the smallest of the deer kind, seldom
standing more than two feet high, measuring from
the shoulder. It is very common in a wild state
in Scotland, particularly on the banks of Loch
Lomond, but it is very seldom met with in parks.
The male of the roe is called a roebuck; the
female, a roe; and the young, a fawn; and these
creatures do not live in herds like the other deer,
but in families of from ten to twenty each.</p>

<p>The natural process by which the horns of deer
are renewed every year is extremely curious,
The time when the change takes place varies in
the different kinds of deer: those of the stag, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
of the buck of the fallow deer, fall off in spring,
and are renewed in summer; but those of the
roebuck fall off in autumn, and are renewed in
winter. Very soon after the old horns fall off,
a soft tumour appears which is covered with a
velvet-like down, and this downy skin remains on
the horns as they shoot upwards, and divide into
antlers. The horns have at this time a very singular
appearance, as the soft downy skin with
which they are covered is completely intersected
with blood-vessels which are designed by nature
to supply nourishment to the horns, and the furrows
formed by the largest of which may always
be afterwards traced in the horn itself. When
the horns have attained their full growth, the
velvet skin with its blood-vessels begins to dry
up; and the stags at this season become very injurious
to trees, as they are continually rubbing
their horns against the bark, in order to get rid
of the skin, which has become troublesome to
them. It is a singular thing, that, though stags
shed their horns every year, the old horns are
scarcely ever found; and it is generally supposed
that the animals bury them as soon as they fall
off. The horns grow with very great rapidity,
and a pair weighing twenty-five pounds have been
known to be formed in ten weeks.</p>

<p>Deer are included in the beasts subject to the
forest laws of England, the others being the fox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
and the marten, and according to some the wild
boar; and there are certain laws still extant respecting
these beasts which are very curious, and
which make it penal to kill them at any but the
proper seasons. Formerly, indeed, killing a deer
unlawfully was considered a more heinous offence
than killing a man.</p>

GUINEA FOWLS, GEESE, DUCKS, AND PIGEONS.&mdash;PEACOCKS
AND HENS.&mdash;DISEASES OF POULTRY, AND THEIR
CURE.</h5>


<p>My hints for teaching you how to enjoy a country
life would be sadly deficient if I were to omit
poultry, as the duties of attending on them are so
completely feminine, that even in farm-houses
they are entirely under the care of females; and,
indeed, few artists or authors would think a picture
of rural life complete, if they did not introduce
into it the image of a fair young girl
feeding poultry. I have just been reading a
description of this kind in Miss Bremer's beautiful
story of <i>Strife and Peace</i>, and it has pleased
me so much, and seems so appropriate, that I
cannot resist the temptation of quoting it.</p>

<p>"The morning was fresh and clear. The September
sun shone brightly into the valley; smoke
rose from the cottages. The lady-mantles in
whose channelled cups clear pearls trembled, the
silver weed with its yellow flowers and silver-bright
leaves, grew along a little footpath which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
wound round the base of a moss-grown hill. It
conducted to a spring of the clearest water, which,
after forming a little pond, led its silver stream,
dancing and murmuring, to the river. On this
beautiful morning Susanna approached the spring;
and in her train came 'cock and hen, and chicken
small.' Before her waddled a troop of geese, gabbling
noisily, and all white but one&mdash;a grey
one. The grey goose walked with a timid, hesitating
air, a little behind the others, compelled to
retain this position by a tyrant in the white flock,
who drove him back with outstretched neck and
loud cry whenever he attempted to approach the
rest. None of the other geese concerned themselves
about their ill-used companion, but Susanna
took it under her especial protection, and did all
in her power to console it for the injustice of its
kind. After the geese came the demure but
clumsy ducks; the petulant turkey-cock, with his
awkward dames, one white and one black; and
last, the turbulent race of chickens, with their
stately pugnacious cocks. The prettiest of all the
party were a flock of pigeons, who timidly, but
confidently at the same time, now alighted on Susanna's
shoulder and outstretched hand, and now
rose in the air and flew in shining circles round
her head; then dropping to the earth, tripped on
their little fringed feet, to drink at the spring;
while the geese, with loud noise, plunged splashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
into the river, and threw the water over the grass
in a pearly shower."</p>

<p>I must now, however, return from the region of
poetry to plain matter of fact.</p>

<p>Fowls should always be kept in a <i>poultry-yard</i>,
or enclosed place set apart for them, as, if allowed
to be at liberty in gardens or pleasure-grounds,
they do a great deal of mischief by half-burying
themselves in newly-raked soil, to clean their feathers
and get rid of vermin; and by scratching up
seeds, and even the roots of plants, in their search
after worms and insects. When circumstances
allow, the poultry-yard should be at least half an
acre in extent, as fowls are never well unless they
are allowed abundance of room for exercise. The
usual form for a poultry-yard is a parallelogram, of
which the hen-houses form one end and a pond
the other. The whole should be surrounded by a
strong fence of paling, and there should be a large
tree, or post with branches fixed in it, in the
centre, with a heap of calcareous earth near it.</p>

<p>The surface of the poultry-yard (fig. 14.) should
be level; and about one half of it should be laid
down with gravel, but the lower part, near the
pond, should be grass, as, unless there is some
kind of herbage, there will be neither insects nor
snails, and poultry require some animal food to
keep them in health. The tree in the centre
should have its branches deprived of their smaller
spray, so that they may afford good roosting-places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
for the pea fowl and guinea fowls, both
of which prefer roosting in the open air. The
upper part of the yard which is near the hen-house,
and which is covered with gravel, ought to
be thoroughly well drained, so as to be as dry as
possible; and the drains ought to be so contrived
as to carry off all the water used in washing the
hen-house, without suffering it to approach the
pond. Where aquatic fowls are kept, it is, indeed,
a good plan for the other fowls to have
drinking-troughs near the hen-house, which should
be filled with pure water every day, and frequently
and carefully cleaned out.</p>

</div>

<p>Besides the hen-house, there should be an open
shed on each side of the poultry-yard, extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
as far as the part laid with gravel. The
ground under one of these sheds should be laid
with the large flag-stones called landing-stones, in
order to have as few joints as possible; and under
the other shed the earth should be dug out to
the depth of a foot or more, and filled up with
dry sand, to enable the fowls to take what may be
called a sand bath, which is the principal means
they have of getting rid of the body vermin with
which they are generally infested, and which are
very troublesome to them. The shed which has
sand at the bottom may have bars under the roof,
to serve as an occasional roosting-place for pea-fowl
and guinea-fowl; but the one which has the flag-stones
should have no bars across it, as the stone
floor is intended to serve as a place for feeding
the fowls on, and it should be kept as clean as
possible. It is a good plan to lay a few handfuls
of unthreshed straw on this stone floor, in order
that the fowls may amuse themselves with scratching
out the grains; and they should always have a
small heap of mortar, rubbish, or lime in one corner
for them to peck, as unless fowls can have access to
lime, or to some kind of calcareous earth, they will
produce eggs without shells.</p>

<p>It is necessary to observe that land fowls are,
generally speaking, much more tender in constitution
than aquatic ones. The common hens, in particular,
will never lay well unless they are kept warm;
and, as a proof of this, it is well known by every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
housekeeper that eggs are much scarcer and dearer
in winter than in summer. As the different kinds
of fowls require different treatment, it is necessary
to keep them separate, and it is also necessary
to keep those hens that are sitting separate from
the rest. On this account the hen-house should be
divided into five compartments, the centre one of
which (<i>a</i>) may be much larger than the others, and
furnished with a fireplace and boiler, for boiling
potatoes and other food, from which should run
hot-water pipes or flues, so contrived as to heat
the whole of the compartments.</p>

<p>On one side of the central room may be a place
for hen turkeys (<i>b</i>), as it is necessary always to
keep them by themselves when they are inclined
to sit; as, if the male turkeys see the eggs, they
generally contrive to break them. Beyond this
should be the roosting-house for the turkeys (<i>c</i>),
provided with strong beams across, at a sufficient
distance from each other, to suit large and heavy
birds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/fig_15.jpg" width="200" alt="wood engraving" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 15. <i>Sitting-box.</i></div>
</div>

<p>On the other side of the central room should be
the compartment devoted to laying and sitting
hens (<i>d</i>) and this should be
fitted up with boxes (fig. 15.)
which are made moveable,
and placed not quite close to
each other, as it disturbs
sitting hens to hear other
hens close to them. The front part of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
box should be made to slide up and down, so
that it may be taken out, and the box thoroughly
cleansed with a brush and soap and
water, when not in use. This sliding front, when
closed, has an arched opening in front for the hens
to go in and out; and this opening is made so as
not to reach quite to the ground, in order not
only to keep the nest warm and in its proper
place, but to prevent any danger of the eggs being
sucked by rats, or other similar depredators.
The hen-room should be frequently whitewashed,
say twice a year, care being taken to do it with
as little disturbance to the fowls as practicable;
and the floor, which should be either of stone, or
laid with bricks, should be swept out every day,
and washed occasionally when the weather is
warm and dry. It is a very good plan to have
the boxes raised with two pieces of wood below
each, so as to leave a hollow space in the middle
below the box, as this plan allows the house to
be cleaned with greater facility.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/fig_16.jpg" width="275" alt="wood engraving" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 16. <i>Hen-roost.</i></div>
</div>

<p>The other room (<i>e</i> in fig. 14.) should be supplied
with rails and perches to serve as roosting-places
(fig. 16.), and
these rails are best of
rough wood, as they afford
a more secure resting-place
for the fowls than
if they were round and
smooth. Fowls are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
apt to crowd together in their roosting-places; and,
when the rails are smooth so that the claws of the
fowls cannot take a firm hold of them, the youngest
and weakest of the fowls are very often pushed
off. The roosting-places should be furnished with
a sloping board with sticks nailed across, to enable
the fowls to ascend to them. All the rooms of
the hen-house should have windows filled in with
wire lattice; and they should have shutters to
close in cold weather. In some cases they have
ceilings like those of a house, and in others they
are left open to the beams of the roof. The principal
thing to attend to is to keep them scrupulously
clean, and the walls frequently whitewashed.
The roosting-place should have the
dung removed every morning, and in warm
weather it should be washed out every day; even
in winter, unless the weather is frosty, the floor
should be washed once a week. Sometimes,
instead of fixed rails for the fowls to rest upon,
hanging bars are suspended from the roof; and
sometimes the nests for laying in and for sitting
are fixed, and in two rows one above the other.
Where danger is apprehended from thieves, the
door of the roosting-house is kept locked, it being
provided with an opening for the fowls to pass
through.</p>

<p>Poultry should never be fed where they roost,
if it can possibly be avoided, and their food should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
generally be given to them in the open shed act
apart for that purpose. In wet weather, however,
they may be fed in the feeding-house (<i>a</i> in fig. 14.),
which has that name because it is the place where
those fowls which are to be fattened are kept under
coops (fig. 17.). For my own part
I am no friend to fattening fowls
artificially, as I think they are never
half so good to eat as when they are
indulged with moderate exercise, and kept in good
condition by feeding them with barley, oats, or
other grain, two or three times a day. When
the poultry-yard adjoins a farm-yard, so that the
fowls can be let out occasionally to pick up the
grains that are scattered by the thresher, they
become so plump and so well fitted for the table,
that it is considered the highest praise that can be
bestowed on poultry, to say that it eats as well as
a barn-door fowl. When it is not practicable to
admit poultry to the farm-yard, the fowls that are
to be fattened should be kept in the feeding-house,
and plenty of unthreshed straw should be given to
them to peck at, so as to let them have constantly
quite as much as they can eat, and yet be obliged
to take exercise to get it; or, if more rapid feeding
be required, they may be put under coops and
fed with various kinds of food, either raw or
cooked.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/fig_17.jpg" width="200" alt="wood engraving" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 17. <i>Coop.</i></div>
</div>

<p>A fowl, when supplied with abundance of food,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
eats rapidly till it has filled its crop, in which the
food is merely stored as grass or hay is in the
paunch of a cow, and from which it passes through
the second stomach into the gizzard, which digests
it, by grinding it into a mass, partly by its own
muscular action, and partly by the help of numerous
little bits of gravel and small stones which
the fowl swallows. This is necessarily a slow
process, when the food consists of hard dry barley;
but of course it is performed much quicker when
the food is softened by boiling, and equally, of
course, the time in which the fowl gets fat is
shortened by the facility with which it can digest
its food. This is the reason why cooked grain is
now preferred for feeding poultry, and boiled rice,
barley, oats, and wheat are given in preference to
the old mixture of barley meal and milk and
water. Boiled or steamed potatoes are also recommended,
and they should always be given warm.
All the fowls may be fed with advantage on this
prepared food, as it makes the hens lay better and
the chickens grow faster, care being taken that
the earthen pans or wooden troughs in which it is
contained are always kept perfectly clean, and
that they are daily scoured with boiling water to
prevent them from acquiring a sour taste. The
boiled food is always given in the feeding-house,
but after eating it the fowls are turned into the
yard to cater for themselves if they feel inclined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
and many persons advise a piece of bullock's liver
or something of the kind to be thrown in the yard,
as far from the hen-house as possible, to breed
maggots, as they are particularly nourishing to
young chickens, who will devour them greedily.
You will observe that I have not given any directions
for cramming fowls, as I am quite sure you
would not suffer any creatures under your control
to be subjected to such treatment.</p>

<p>Poultry are particularly liable to be attacked
by body vermin, and, while they are annoyed by
these torments, they will never feed properly. It
is, therefore, of the greatest importance that the
places in which they are kept should be perfectly
clean, and that they should have abundance of
sand, in which they can wallow whenever they
feel inclined.</p>

<p>Domestic fowls are very pugnacious, and if
there are too many cocks they will be fighting
incessantly. The usual proportion is one cock
to seven hens; and those hens should be kept
for laying which are dark-coloured, as they are
not only better layers, but are said to produce
richer eggs. When a hen is about to begin laying
she makes a cackling noise for several days,
when a nest of hay should be prepared for her,
and a nest egg put into it, to induce her to lay
there. Some hens lay every day, and others only
once in two days, or once in three days. The eggs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
should be removed as soon as laid, as the hen is
apt to spoil or break them, by sitting in the nest
to lay others. Eggs may be kept for several
months sufficiently fresh either for setting or for
the table, by dipping them either in oil, or in a
mixture of beef suet and mutton fat melted together
and used warm. Hens are considered in
their prime at three years old, but they will produce
eggs for several years; and some hens will
continue laying all the year, except during the
season for moulting, which happens with young
fowls in spring, and with older ones generally in
autumn. At this season all birds are ill, particularly
at the time when the new feathers have just
forced out the old ones, and have their quills full
of blood to furnish nutriment for their growth.</p>

<p>When a hen is set, care should be taken that
she has only as many eggs as she can cover easily.
The usual number is from nine to thirteen; and,
when they have been put into the nest, the hen
should be placed gently upon them, and covered
with a cloth till she seems quiet. When a hen
is sitting, she should be plentifully supplied with
water near at hand, as she is generally thirsty,
but it is reckoned best not to put her food too
close to her, as a little exercise does her good. A
hen sits twenty-one days, but some of the chickens
are generally hatched a day sooner or later. Each is
taken from the hen as soon as it has left the egg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
and is put in a basket on some wool or flannel,
and set by the fire; but no food is given till all
the brood is hatched, and returned to the hen. The
chickens are then fed with eggs boiled hard and
chopped small, and boiled rice and grits; and,
when they are a little bigger, they may be given
barley meal mixed with milk and water, or, what
is better, boiled barley and rice, with a few boiled
potatoes crumbled small. They will soon, however,
be strong enough to feed with the hen in
shallow vessels; as otherwise they are apt to get
into the water to drink, and wetting their feet
and feathers brings on many diseases. As soon
as the chickens are hatched, a little bit of wood,
with a strip nailed across it, to serve as a step,
should be put from the opening of the box where
the nest is to the ground, to enable the chickens
to get in and out of the nest as easily as possible;
and when they are permitted to go out of doors,
which is generally in three or four days, the hen
should be put under a coop, to prevent her from
wandering, till the chickens are strong enough to
accompany her, which will probably be in about
ten or fifteen days.</p>

<p>There are many opinions as to what <i>kinds of
fowls</i> are the best; but it is very difficult to
decide this question, as almost all the kinds have
advantages and disadvantages peculiar to themselves;
though those are usually preferred which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
have rather short and slender legs, and round,
compact, fleshy bodies. White or very light-coloured
fowls are considered best for the table;
but they are said to be tender in constitution and
not good layers. The common barn-door fowl is
the original stock from which most of the varieties
are derived. The Game fowl are perhaps the
best for the table; but the eggs are small, and the
chickens are difficult to rear, unless they can be
supplied with maggots or some other kind of
animal food. The Dorking fowls are preferred
for the table by the caterers for the London
market, on account of their large size. They
have generally two hind toes instead of one. The
Jago, or Cochin-China, fowls are so very large
that it is said they can pick crumbs from a table
as they stand on the ground, and they often
weigh from eight to ten pounds. They have
double combs and tufts of feathers on the head:
the feathers on the body are mottled, but those of
the tail are a dark glossy green. The eggs are
very large and good. The Crested, or Polish, fowl
is black, with a white tuft on the head. The hens
are excellent layers, and the chickens are good for
the table; but the hens are not good sitters, and
are apt to lay away. The Spanish fowls are also
black, and very large and handsome. The Malay
fowls are very large, and the colour of the feathers
is black, streaked with brown and yellow. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
are excellent layers; and their eggs, which are
very large, have so much yolk, that two of their
eggs will go as far as three of those of ordinary
fowls. The flesh is exceedingly juicy and fine-flavoured;
but the legs of the fowls are rather too
large and strong to look well on the table. I
speak confidently of these fowls being good, both
for the table and as layers, because our very kind
friend Charles Waterton, Esq., keeps no others
at Walton Hall.</p>

<p>Bantam fowls are very small, with short legs,
which are generally feathered down to the toes.
They are much admired as ornamental fowls, but
are of little use, either for the table or as layers,
from their very small size.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of what may be called
fancy fowls; but I shall only mention one of them,
and this is the Frizzled fowl, or, as it is sometimes
called, the Friesland fowl, though the name appears
to have no meaning, and to have been only
adopted from its resemblance to frizzled. This
fowl is a native of Japan, and it certainly has a
very singular appearance, from its feathers being
curled up and apparently all turned the wrong
way. It is, however, not worth keeping, except
as an object of curiosity; as the fowls are small
and bad layers, and the chickens are difficult to
rear, being extremely sensitive to cold and wet.</p>

<p><i>Turkeys</i> are very wild in their habits, and apt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
to stray, and their young are considered difficult
to rear. Turkey-hens begin to lay in March,
laying either every day or every other day; and,
during their laying season, many persons will not
let them out of their roosting-place in a morning
till they have laid, on account of their propensity
to lay away. One turkey-cock is sufficient for
several hens; and if there are two they generally
fight till the strongest has killed the weakest.</p>

<p>When a turkey-hen is about to sit, her nest is
made by twisting a pad of straw like those worn
by basket-women on their heads, and soft hay is
laid in the middle; this is done on account of
the projecting breast-bone of the turkey, which
makes it difficult for her to cover her eggs, unless
she has some support. Hen turkeys begin to
sit in April; the number of eggs is generally
eleven or thirteen, and they sit from twenty-five
to thirty days. It was formerly customary, as the
young were hatched, to take them away from the
hen, and, opening the beak with the fingers, to
force one or two peppercorns down the poor little
creatures' throats; but now this mode of proceeding
is thought unnecessary, and the young are left
with their mother till they are all hatched. They
may be then fed with crumbled curds mixed with
chives or nettles chopped small. Eggs boiled hard
and cut into little bits; and mutton or beef without
salt, boiled so much as to tear easily into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
shreds, are also given. The old bird should then
be put with her young ones under a coop in the
hatching-house, and water should be placed within
her reach and that of her young. In a few days
the young ones, with their mother still under the
coop, may be taken into the open air; but they
should not be allowed to remain there longer than
two or three hours at a time till they are about
ten days old; and the mother should be kept in
her coop under the open shed till they are about
six weeks old, so that till they have attained that
age they may always have a warm dry place to
fly to. Great numbers of turkey chickens die
young for want of these precautions being attended
to.</p>

<p>When turkey chickens are about two months
old, they are called turkey poults, and about
this time the fleshy membranes on the head and
neck begin to appear. This is called shooting
the red; and a great many young turkeys die at
this time, unless they are well fed and kept
warm. Those turkey poults which survive this
period are generally reared, and when about six
months old some of them may be fattened for the
table. At twelve months old they lose the name
of poults, and are considered full-grown turkeys.</p>

<p><i>Guinea fowls</i> can very seldom be persuaded to
enter a hen-house; they like to roost in the open
air, and to lay in a bush or some similar situation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
and, where they are kept, a few bushes should be
planted in the poultry-yard for their accommodation.
The hen seldom sits on more than seven
eggs; and when her young are hatched they
should be treated like young turkeys, and the hen
should be put under a coop in the turkey-house.
When the young fowls get old enough to be
taken into the open air, the hen should be kept
under a coop in the open shed till the young are
about two months old, as she is a most restless
creature, and would soon kill the young ones with
fatigue, if her activity were not checked.</p>

<p><i>Peacocks</i> should never be kept in a poultry-yard,
as they have a propensity for killing all the
young fowls they can reach, by giving them a
violent blow with the beak on the crown of the
head. They will even kill their own young in a
similar way, if they see them before the tuft of
feathers on the head has grown. Pea-hens are
very fond of laying in bushes or hedges, like
guinea fowl, and when they are kept in pleasure-grounds
with peacocks they should be narrowly
watched. If they are observed to steal secretly
into a bush or hedge, the place should be marked
and examined when the pea-hen has left it; and,
if a nest is found, all the eggs should be carefully
removed but one. In doing this the eggs should
be handled as little as possible, as pea-hens are
very particular, and will not sit upon their eggs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
if they have been touched by persons with moist
hands. When I lived in the country, I never
could rear pea-fowls till the idea struck me of
making the little country girl whom I used to
employ to hunt for the eggs wear gloves, and
after that time I never found any difficulty in
getting the pea-hens to sit.</p>

<p>When the pea-hen has laid from five to seven
eggs she generally shows a disposition to sit, or
rather she begins to sit on the nest she has made
for herself. When this is the case she should be
left on her nest till night, and when it is dark a
cloth should be put over her, and she should be
conveyed, nest and all, if practicable, to either the
turkey's hatching-house or the feeding-house, where
she should be placed on a nest prepared for her,
containing all her own eggs, and then covered
with a coop, and a cloth thrown over that. When
she has settled comfortably the cloth may be removed;
but she should be kept under the coop
the whole time she is sitting. When the young
ones are hatched they are treated in the same
manner as young turkeys, and, when their head-feathers
begin to grow, they suffer nearly as much
as the turkey poults do when shooting the red.</p>

<p><i>The houses for the aquatic fowls</i> should be at
the bottom of the poultry-yard, near the pool, and
they should consist of separate divisions for the
sleeping and laying places of both geese and ducks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
A feeding-house is often added, and this is especially
necessary when either ducks or geese are to be
put up to feed. Though aquatic fowls, and particularly
ducks, are proverbially fond of dirt, the house
in which they are kept should be as clean as possible;
and it should not only be frequently washed
out, but thoroughly ventilated by the door being
left open all day. The smell of goose dung is
very offensive; and if the house in which the
geese sleep be not kept very clean, it will materially
deteriorate the pleasure you will have in
visiting your poultry-yard.</p>

<p>Many people object to <i>geese</i> in a poultry-yard
on account of the pugnacious habits of the gander;
but when a gander is brought up with other
fowls he becomes familiar with them, and is not
likely to do them any injury. One gander is
sufficient for several geese; and four or five geese
will bring up a brood of forty or fifty goslings.
Geese generally lay every other day; or, if they
lay two days together, they miss the third day.
They generally begin to lay in March, and lay
from eight to twelve eggs before they show any
signs of wishing to sit. Sometimes, if they are
well fed, and the eggs taken away, they will continue
laying as many as twenty or even more.</p>

<p>When a goose is inclined to sit, she begins to
carry straws about in her mouth as if to prepare
for making a nest; and, when this is the case, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
nest should be prepared for her containing eleven
or thirteen eggs. The nest should be made in a
box in one of the houses for aquatic fowls, and
food should be placed near her, as geese sit very
closely, and sometimes suffer themselves to be
half-starved rather than leave the nest. A goose
should, however, be frequently examined while
sitting, as from her nest being close to the ground
it is very liable to be attacked by rats, who will
frequently contrive to get the eggs from under the
goose without her being able to prevent it.</p>

<p>Geese are voracious feeders, and eat a great
deal of grass as well as of more substantial food.
When they are to be fattened for the table they
are put under coops, and fed principally on oats
moistened with water; but at other times they
may be fed on any kind of refuse vegetable mixed
with any sort of corn, and with boiled potatoes,
carrots, and turnips. When geese are fattened
before they are six weeks or two months old they
are termed green geese; and those which are kept
a little longer, so as to be ready for Michaelmas,
are called stubble-geese, because, if turned into
the corn-fields after the crop has been carried,
they will generally find amongst the stubble
enough grain, which has been dropped from the
sheaves, to fatten them.</p>

<p><i>Ducks</i> require more water than geese, and they
eat less grass, though they are always better when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
grass is within their reach, on account of the great
number of slugs and other similar creatures that
they find among it. Ducks are celebrated for the
voracity and coarseness of their appetites. They
begin to lay in February, and will sometimes lay
as many as fifty eggs before they show any inclination
to sit. They are, indeed, generally bad
sitters, and will forsake their eggs if they have
not plenty of food and water placed within their
reach. From nine to eleven eggs are as much as
a duck can cover, and, if she has more than that
number, or any she does not like, she will turn
them out of the nest without the least ceremony.</p>

<p>A duck generally sits thirty days; but a short
time before the expiration of that period a coop
should be put over her, or else, very probably, as
soon as two or three ducklings are hatched she
will take them to the water, and desert the remaining
eggs. Young ducklings are very hardy
under ordinary circumstances; but this treatment
frequently kills them, as if the water be at all
cold they are generally seized with cramp, and
die a few hours after they are hatched. It is
on account of ducks being so careless of their
young that ducks' eggs are frequently set under
hens.</p>

<p>Ducklings, when first hatched, are generally fed
upon oatmeal mixed with chopped nettles; and,
when they are a little stronger, they are given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
bran soaked in water, and boiled potatoes. It is
also a good plan to throw a handful of oats or
barley into the water given to them to drink, for
them to dabble for, that they may get accustomed
to the water by degrees. The mother should,
however, be kept under a coop till the young
ducklings are ten days old, to prevent her from
taking them into the water till they are strong
enough to bear it.</p>

<p>When ducks are to be fattened they must be
kept under a coop, and fed with boiled potatoes
mixed with oatmeal and bruised oats. Acorns
ground or bruised are a favourite food with them,
and very fattening. Malt-dust is likewise recommended;
but barley is said to give them a bad
flavour. The Muscovy ducks should not be kept
in the poultry-yard, as they are so much larger
and stronger than the common kind that they are
apt to fight with them and deprive them of their
food; and they are more suitable to the park and
pleasure-ground.</p>

<p>There may be a dove-cot for <i>pigeons</i> in the
poultry-yard with the other fowls. When the
pigeon-house is large, it is generally built round
like a tower from the ground upwards; but where
this is inconvenient, a small wooden dove-cot may
be fixed against the walk. In your case I would decidedly
advise you to have a pigeon-house in your
poultry-yard; and, if it is built like a tower,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
there should be holes in the upper part for the birds
to enter by, with a shelf under each row of holes,
and a little penthouse projecting from the roof to
keep out the wet. The interior of the pigeon-house
must have cells for nests, which are made
by putting up shelves twenty inches wide and one
foot apart, and dividing the spaces between them
by upright partitions, three feet from each other.
Across the back of each nest there should be a
board three inches wide, sliding up and down in a
groove, to prevent the young ones from falling
out, and yet to allow of the nest being cleaned.
When the house has been stocked with pigeons, a
little hay or soft straw is put into each cell for
the pigeon to form its nest. Some persons divide
each cell into two nests, as, when the young are
about a fortnight old, the female, without waiting
till they are fledged, often begins to lay again; and,
when there is only one nest, it is not an uncommon
thing to see a female pigeon sitting on a fresh set
of eggs, while the young of the former hatching
are still under her care. When a pigeon-house is
to be stocked, a number of young birds are obtained
either in May or August, when they are
in the state called squeakers, that is to say, not
fully grown, but able to feed themselves.</p>

<p>When the female pigeon begins to lay, she produces
only one egg, and then waits a day or two,
after which she lays another, and immediately proceeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
to sit. She continues sitting from fifteen
to twenty days, or rather the male and female sit
alternately during that time; but, as soon as the
young pigeons are hatched, the mother never
leaves them, for the space of three days, though
after that time she commits them, very frequently,
almost entirely to the care of a male, who feeds
them in the same manner as she does herself, by
swallowing peas or other large seeds, and, after
keeping them in the crop till they are partly
macerated, forcing them up again, and ejecting
them into the open mouths of the young ones.
While the young are thus fed, they are called
squabs, and in that state they are reckoned best
for pies; but, when they get old enough to feed
themselves, they are called squeakers. They
breed very often, but only continue prolific for a
few years, and are, in general, short-lived.</p>

<p>A pigeon-house soon becomes very dirty, and
has a most intolerable smell; it should, therefore,
be cleaned out as often as practicable, taking care
that the cleaning is always done in the morning
before mid-day, as pigeons go to roost very early,
and, if disturbed in the afternoon, they will very
often take a sulky fit, and sit outside of the pigeon-house
all night.</p>

<p>Pigeons should always be fed in the open
air, with peas, small horse-beans, buck-wheat,
and old tares, as new tares are said to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
unwholesome. They should be supplied with
abundance of water, some in a shallow vessel for
them to wash in, and some in a wooden trough
for them to drink; as they are very cleanly, and
will not drink the same water that they have
washed in, though they require more water to
drink than any of the other inhabitants of the
poultry-yard. They require to have access to
gravel or sand, and it is customary to supply them
with a heap of lime rubbish, over which salt and
water has been poured; and in some cases this is
put into an earthenware vessel with holes in it,
called a salt cat; in other cases a little salt is
thrown over a heap of sifted gravel. When
pigeons are put in a new house, it is customary to
give them cummin seed or asafœtida, as they are
so fond of these strong-smelling substances, that
they soon take a liking to any place where they
are to be found.</p>

<p>Pigeons are very hardy, and are subject to very
few diseases. The two eggs laid by the female
pigeon generally produce a male and female bird;
and, when this is the case, if by any chance one
of them is killed, it is very difficult to provide the
other with a mate. Pigeons are proverbial for
their constancy, and the same pair will produce
broods for several years in succession.</p>

<p>The <i>diseases of poultry</i> are very numerous
and often fatal. The <i>pip</i> comes in the shape of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
a little blister on the tip of the tongue, which
afterwards becomes a thickened membrane. If
seen in its first state it should be pricked, and
the fowl kept a day or two without food, but
plenty of water should be given to it. If the
membrane has formed, the fowl is thrown on its
back, and, the beak being opened, the membrane
is removed by passing the finger nail or a fine
needle under it. The tongue is then moistened
with a little oil, and the fowl for a few days is
given very little to eat, but plenty of water to
drink: some persons give fowls affected with this
disease rue chopped fine and mixed with butter.
It is a very common disease with young fowls,
and generally attacks them, if the weather should
be hot, in August and September. When fowls
appear to suffer from immoderate thirst, it is a
sign of <i>fever</i>, and they should be supplied with
abundance of clear water, and only fed with a
little soaked bread; and a similar mode of treatment
is generally efficacious when the fowl appears
to suffer from constipation. When a fowl
is <i>crop-sick</i>, that is, suffers from indigestion, it
is usual to put a piece of iron in some of the
water given to it, but it should also have plenty
of pure water. Pepper is often given, and no other
food is allowed than mashed potatoes or boiled
cabbage cut small, and both given warm. When
fowls have a voracious appetite, and yet look out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
of condition, it probably arises from the fowl
having too much acid on its stomach, and it should
be fed with mashed potatoes mixed with chalk
and given warm. In <i>diarrhœa</i> boiled rice is given,
occasionally mixed with milk, taking care, however,
that the milk is perfectly sweet; or chalk
may be given, and the fowl fed on wheat, oats, or
buck-wheat. The <i>roup</i>, or influenza, is, however,
the most fatal of all the diseases which attack
poultry. It begins with what is called the gapes;
that is, the fowl, being unable to breathe through
its nostrils, keeps its beak open, with a kind of
convulsive yawn; the eyelids then become swelled
and close, and there is an offensive discharge from
the nostrils. As soon as any fowl is observed to
be affected with this disease, it should be separated
from the rest, as the disease is very infectious.
The mouth and nostrils should be first washed
with warm water and soap (which will make the
creature sneeze and discharge a great quantity of
the offensive matter), and then gently rubbed
with a dry cloth. A grain of calomel made into
a pill with bread may be given, and the fowl
put into a rabbit-hutch near the fire, on a bed of
soft warm hay. Some hours afterwards the head
should be again washed in warm water and
rubbed dry, and the fowl should be crammed with
a few balls made of barley meal, flour, mustard,
and grated ginger; and warm water with treacle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
in it should be given to drink. The hay should
be changed twice a day, and warmed before it is
given. The washing and feeding should be repeated
several times a day, and in about a week a
little more calomel should be given, and afterwards
flowers of sulphur. This treatment will
soon effect a cure.</p>

<h4><a name="LETTER_XVI" id="LETTER_XVI">LETTER XVI.</a></h4>

<h5>THE INHABITANTS OF THE PONDS: FISH; AND AQUATIC
FOWLS, INCLUDING SWANS, EXOTIC GEESE AND DUCKS.&mdash;INHABITANTS
OF THE WOODS: INCLUDING PHEASANTS
AND PARTRIDGES, HERONS AND BITTERNS.&mdash;AVIARY.&mdash;APIARY,
AND THE MANAGEMENT OF BEES.&mdash;SILK-WORMS.</h5>


<p>When a fish-pond is to be made, a situation
should be chosen where there is a natural hollow,
so that the ground which is to form the bottom of
the pond may be as little disturbed as possible.
If this situation be near a river so that a feeder
may be led into it, nothing else is wanted to form
a fish-pond but an embankment and a sluice, and
these you must have made by persons used to
such employments. It is necessary, however, to
take care that the pond is fed from a river, as
spring water is not only too cold for the fish, but
is seldom quite free from mineral substances.
The pond should be made at least six feet deep,
and if twelve feet or more it will be better for
the fish: as in frosty weather they will remain
near the bottom, and will find enough air in the
great body of water above them to enable them
to live a long time after the surface is frozen
over; while, on the contrary, if the pond be shallow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
the fish will soon exhaust all the air it contains,
and will perish unless the ice be frequently
broken, to admit air from the atmosphere. In
shallow ponds, also, the rushes and other weeds
grow so fast as to occasion considerable expense
and trouble in having them cleared away.</p>

<p>The extent of a pond must depend upon circumstances,
but it should never be less than five
or six acres, and as much more as is convenient;
in shape it should be rather long, as regards the
front of the mansion, than broad, and its outline
should either be varied, or broken by planting
trees and shrubs in small groups on its banks.
Where ponds are intended solely for fish, without
regard to their appearance in the landscape, their
banks should be quite straight, and their shape
square or oblong. The pond, whether ornamental
or not, may be divided into two parts by an embankment
in the centre, which is kept about two
feet below the general surface of the water when
the pond is full. The use of this is, that, when
the pond is to be run dry, either for clearing it
of its mud or catching the larger fish, only one
half need be emptied at a time; and the other
half may serve as a place to put the store fish
in while the first division is being cleared out;
and, when that is quite clean and the water let
into it again, the fish may be transferred to it while
the second half is being cleared. Of course, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
to this arrangement, there must be a
wooden sluice for letting off the water in each
division. The beauty of a pond depends principally
upon its being well supplied with water,
and this constant supply can only be insured
during the summer months, by having a brook
or rivulet running through the pond. Where the
pond is of sufficient size, there should be an island
or two for the swans and other aquatic birds to
make their nests on.</p>

<p>Where several kinds of fish are desired, different
soils may be laid at the bottom of the pond, to
suit the fish which breed in it. Thus, trout will
never thrive unless the pond in which they are
kept has a gravelly bottom. Carp (of which there
are two kinds, the common, and the Prussian
which is much smaller than the other,) and tench
require loam, with abundance of aquatic weeds;
and eels will only thrive in mud. It is very
seldom practicable to keep all kinds of fish in the
same pond, as some kinds destroy other kinds;
but providing them with different bottoms is the
most effectual way of keeping them, as they will
remain in separate communities in the part of the
pond that suits them best.</p>

<p>Of the kinds of fishes with which a pond should
be stocked, carp are, perhaps, generally speaking,
the best. They breed rapidly, are very hardy,
and grow very fast. Tench resemble carp in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
these qualities, and both are quiet fish, which
would live together without fighting or destroying
each other. Perch, on the contrary, are said
to be so ravenous that they will devour their own
spawn, and that of other fishes. They breed
freely and are quite hardy, but do not grow
rapidly. Trout, when kept in ponds, are rather
ravenous; but pike far exceed all other fish in
this respect. A large pike will destroy nearly all
the small weak fishes in a pond; and, indeed, he
has been known to seize young ducks, and devour
them. These and similar acts have obtained for
the pike the name of the fresh-water shark.
Amongst the other enemies to young fish are
counted the little creatures called sticklebacks,
which are so small, and apparently so insignificant,
that no one would suppose it possible
that they could prevent the stocking of a pond.
They do so, however, by devouring the spawn,
and thus preventing the number of fishes from
increasing. When a pond is once stocked very
little care is necessary; the principal thing which
needs to be attended to being to break the ice in
severe frosts to supply the fish with air, if the
pond should not be deep enough to render this
unnecessary. When fish appear to want feeding,
earthworms, steeped grain, and ground malt,
should be thrown into the water.</p>

<p>Besides the regular fish-ponds, it is very convenient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
in the country to have small ponds or stews
adjoining the kitchen-garden, or somewhere contiguous
to the house, where fish can be kept and
fed, and yet caught at any moment when they
may be required. Carp and tench are the best
fish for keeping in stews, as they are the quietest;
but, as stews are so contrived that the different
kinds of fish may be kept in them separate from
each other, perch may be kept in one of the
divisions, and fed with garbage or any refuse
animal food from the kitchen, till they have
attained a large size. Pike might be kept in
another stew in the same manner, but a pike
should never be put into a stew with any other
fish.</p>

<p>Every pond in a pleasure-ground should have
some ornamental aquatic fowls upon it to make it
look complete; as without some kind of living
creature, the finest piece of water in the world
would have a look of coldness and desolation.</p>

<p>Of all the ornamental aquatic fowls known in
England, the <i>swan</i>, though perhaps the commonest,
is the noblest; and it has the advantage
of being useful in clearing ponds of weeds as well
as being ornamental. A swan should generally
have a pond at least three acres in extent, and
they seldom thrive unless there is an island in
the centre overgrown with long grass or underwood,
in which they can make their nests. Swans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
are tolerably hardy, and only require to be taken
up in time of frost. They are very fond of rambling
over grass when they feel themselves in
perfect security; and they eat a great quantity of
slugs and snails when thus employed.</p>

<p>In the month of May the female swan generally
prepares to make her nest, which she does
secretly, as, if the cobb or male bird perceives her,
he will prevent her if possible. The cygnets, or
young swans, are generally hatched about July,
and when they first appear their feathers are of a
dingy brown instead of being white. When they
first go into the water the female, or pen bird, as
she is called, only lets them swim a little way,
and then, if they appear tired, she takes them on
her back. When the cygnets grow bigger, the
mother swims round the pond with them following
after her like a company of soldiers. As soon
as they get about three parts grown, the cobb
drives them away from their mother, and forces
them to provide for themselves. At this period,
if they happen to have been hatched late, they
may be fed with boiled barley and bread. They
do not become perfectly white till the second year.</p>

<p>When two full-grown cobb swans quarrel they
fight tremendously; and, though the common
species is called the mute swan, they make a loud
hissing noise something like that of the goose, but
louder and hoarser. A cobb swan will also, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
enraged, attack a dog, or even a man, striking
tremendous blows with its wings. It is said that
a full-grown swan could break a man's arm with
a blow of its wing. Swans were formerly considered
royal birds; and those upon the river
Thames are still the property of the crown, and
the young ones are marked every year under the
superintendence of the Lord Mayor, the ceremony
being called swan-hopping, which is said to be
derived from swan-upping, a part of the ceremony
being to decide how far up the river the swans
have a right to go.</p>

<p>In hard frosts the swans, and all the other ornamental
aquatic fowls, must be sheltered, and fed
in the same way as the common ducks and geese
in the poultry-yard; and there is generally some
place contrived near the water for this purpose;
as, for example, under the fishing-house, or adjoining
the boat-house. It is also necessary to
take some means of preventing aquatic fowls from
flying away, and the barbarous operation of cutting
off one joint of the wing with a penknife, or a
very fine saw made from the spring of a watch,
is frequently resorted to; it being the second
joint of the wing that is taken off. For my own
part, I should prefer losing my birds to resorting
to such measures for their preservation; and I
think I have understood, that, by depriving them
of the alternate feathers of their wings, they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
be rendered incapable of flying while they are
strangers to the place, and I would trust to
kind treatment to make them wish to stay with
me when we became better acquainted.</p>

<p>The <i>black swan</i> is a native of Australia, and
it is so common in that country, that it gives its
name to the Swan River. In a wild state, it is
generally seen floating on lakes or rivers, in long
lines formed by eight or ten or more swans swimming
in a single file; and when alarmed they rise
all together and fly off, uttering wild but not unmusical
screams, retaining in the air the same
position as that they occupied in the water. You
must, however, take care, if you put a black swan
on the some water with the white ones, that
they do not injure it. Some years ago, two white
swans on the water in the Regent's Park pursued
a black one with the greatest ferocity; and,
according to Mr. Yarrell, from whom I have taken
this account, one of them having succeeded in
grasping the black swan's neck between the mandibles
of its beak, shook it violently. The black
swan with difficulty extricated itself from this
murderous grasp, hurried on shore, tottered from
the water's edge a few paces, and then fell to die.
The white swans did not attempt to pursue it,
but continued sailing up and down the water with
every feather on end, and seeming proud of their
conquest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>Of <i>geese</i> there are many ornamental kinds.</p>

<p>The <i>Chinese goose</i> is a beautiful creature, which
breeds readily in this country.</p>

<p>The <i>bean goose</i> is frequently kept on ornamental
pieces of water; and a pair belonging to the
Ornithological Society of London have produced
young in St. James's Park, and are remarkably
tame. This goose has received its name from its
fondness for beans and other pulse; and it is one
of the three species of wild geese which pay passing
visits to the ponds and lakes in the North of
England and Scotland. It is found in great abundance
in the Hebrides and other western islands of
Scotland; and large flocks fly together, either in a
diagonal line or in two such lines forming an
acute angle, making a loud cackling noise as they
fly, and going, as has been supposed, at the rate
of more than twenty miles an hour.</p>

<p>The <i>Canada geese</i> are very remarkable in their
appearance, from their glossy black necks and
white cheeks, and their very remarkable trumpet-like
notes. These birds appear in such quantities
in Canada, that it is calculated that two or three
thousand are killed every year by the English at
Hudson's Bay. This bird is sometimes called the
cravat goose; its beautiful black and glossy neck
and white breast bearing considerable resemblance
to a black silk cravat upon a white shirt.</p>

<p>The <i>bernicle</i>, or brent goose, is interesting from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
the curious superstition which formerly prevailed
respecting it, as it was supposed to have sprung
from the shell called the barnacle or lepas, which
adheres to the bottoms of ships, and which has a
fringe of cirri projecting from between its valves
bearing some faint resemblance to the feathers of a
bird. These geese are very small, and not above
half the size of the Canada geese; and yet Mr.
Waterton found a large old Canada goose on his
noble sheet of water at Walton Hall pair with
a bernicle gander.</p>

<p>The <i>Egyptian goose</i> is interesting from the
strong resemblance it bears to the figures of a
goose found in Egyptian hieroglyphics, in which
it was the emblem of caution.</p>

<p>Amongst the other ornamental kinds of geese
found on ponds in pleasure-grounds, I may
mention the <i>snow</i>, or <i>red, goose</i> from North America,
which is of large size, and has its bill armed
with twenty-three strong indentations like teeth;
and the <i>laughing goose</i>, which has a white front,
and makes a strange laughing-like noise. There
is also an African goose called the <i>gambo</i>, which
is furnished with a curious spur on the upper part
of the wing.</p>

<p>Of the ornamental <i>ducks</i> the best known
species is that with red wattles on its head and
neck, which is generally called the <i>Muscovy
duck</i>, but which is not, as its name imports, a
native of Muscovy; for the name is a corruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
of moschata or musk duck, in allusion to the
peculiar smell of the creature. These ducks are
found wild in Guiana, where they nestle on the
trunks of trees close to the water's edge. They
are easily managed in this country, but require
protection in cold weather. They breed freely,
and are not difficult to rear, except about the time
when the red wattles appear round the head,
when many of them die. In other respects they
considerably resemble the common duck.</p>

<p>The <i>shieldrake</i>, or burrow duck, is remarkable
for its constancy, as a male and female
when they once pair continue to breed together
every year as long as they live. This duck is
also one of the most beautiful of the ornamental
water-fowl. In its native state it is generally
found on the sea-coast, or within a few miles of
the sea, where it breeds in rabbit burrows and
other holes in sandy soils. It will, however, live
in an inland situation, provided it is fed with
periwinkles and other shell-fish, and hence it was
originally called the shelldrake. In some parts
of Scotland it is called the skeeling goose.</p>

<p>There is another species of shieldrake which
is sometimes called the <i>ruddy goose</i>, and which
has a glossy black ring round its neck and
a reddish breast. This bird has the same burrowing
habits as the common species, but it
prefers the neighbourhood of a river to that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
the sea. The voice of this bird when flying is
said to resemble the tone of a clarinet; but in a
state of confinement it bears more resemblance
to the cry of a peacock.</p>

<p>The <i>shoveller</i>, or broad-bill, is a fowl occasionally
kept on ponds in pleasure-grounds. In a
wild state it inhabits marshes and the muddy
shores of lakes and rivers, and is generally considered
only a winter visitor to this country,
though some remain every year to breed. They
feed principally on insects, and are so fond of
flies, that one of the common names of this
species in France is <i>canard gobe-mouche</i>. The
English name of shoveller alludes to the broad
beak, each mandible of which is bordered with
close set rows of teeth resembling those of a
weaver's reed, and which fitting into each other
form a kind of sieve. With this beak the shoveller
digs up the soft mud, and letting its watery
particles escape, retains the very small worms and
other insects which constitute the principal food
of the bird. These ducks being very ornamental
and curious, many attempts have been made to
keep them on the ornamental pieces of water in
the London parks and gardens, but hitherto without
success; for I am told, on the authority of
our excellent friend Captain Mangles, that, though
they may appear healthy for a time, they are very
apt to die off suddenly without any apparent cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>gadwall</i>, or grey duck, is an ornamental
bird; but it is of little use to have it in pleasure-grounds,
as it is so shy, and so fond of hiding
itself among thick weeds and long grass, that
the pair in the Zoological Society's gardens are
scarcely ever seen.</p>

<p>The <i>pintail duck</i>, or sea pheasant, though also
shy in its native habitats, is more easily tamed,
and is well deserving of being kept on ornamental
pieces of water, not only from the beauty of its
plumage, but from the singular appearance produced
by its long tail when it is swimming on
the water. This bird has a singular patch of
green on its wings, and yellow feet. It is very
difficult to get it to breed.</p>

<p>The <i>teal</i> is the smallest of the British ducks,
and one of the prettiest. Its breast is spotted
with black tinged with purple, and it has a rich
dark-brown mark on its head, encircling the eye
and spreading down the back of the neck. The
teal bears confinement well, and it breeds regularly
every year in the gardens of the Zoological
Society. The eggs are white tinged with buff,
and generally about an inch and a half in length.
The nest is formed of decayed vegetable matter,
lined with down and feathers, and it contains eight
or ten eggs. The teal feeds on grass and water
plants, and also on various kinds of insects; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
when kept in this country all the year, during the
winter it requires grain.</p>

<p>The <i>widgeon</i>, Mr. Waterton tells us, "is a
much more familiar bird than either the pochard
or the teal. While these congregate on the water,
beyond the reach of man, the widgeon appears
to have divested itself of the timidity observable
in all other species of wild-fowl, and approaches
very near to our habitations." The widgeon has
such a shrill cry, that it is sometimes called the
whistling duck.</p>

<p>The American widgeon is the constant attendant
on the <i>canvass-back duck</i>, so celebrated in
the United States for its excellence as an article
of food. These ducks have been introduced into
England, but they do not thrive in this country
probably for want of a species of Vallisnèria on
which they feed in their native land. The best
way of managing them would be, to give them
plenty of grain, particularly wheat, of which
they are remarkably fond; though, probably,
buck-wheat would answer the purpose, and would
be much more economical. The Vallisnèria, also,
on which they feed, might be introduced into
England, though it would require to be grown in
running water.</p>

<p>The <i>eider duck</i> is very scarce on ornamental
pieces of water, though it is abundant in the North,
particularly on the Fern Islands off the coast of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
Northumberland, and especially on St. Cuthbert's
rock; and hence it is sometimes called St Cuthbert's
duck. It was long supposed that the eider
duck would not live in confinement; but the
Earl of Derby has several in his splendid collection
at Knowsley, which were reared by feeding
them on slugs and other mollusca.</p>

<p>The king duck, the beautiful little western duck,
the magnificent surf scoter, and the red-crested
duck (a beautiful stuffed specimen of which is in
the possession of Mr. Waterton), are all highly
ornamental, and well deserve to be kept in pleasure-grounds
for their beauty.</p>

<p>The <i>pochard</i>, or dun bird, is remarkable for the
excellence of its flesh, which closely resembles that
of the celebrated canvass-back duck of America.
Like that duck it feeds greedily on a species of
Vallisnèria and on grass-wrack and sea grass
(<i>Rúpia marítima</i>); which last, Mr. Yarrell tells
us, is "called also in America eel-grass, from the
form and length of the stem. The ducks dive and
pull up these aquatic plants to obtain the tender
roots, the only part they seem to eat. The two
plants last named are common near the coast in
England."</p>

<p>I think you will now be pretty well tired of
aquatic fowls; and therefore I will only mention
one more, viz. the <i>coot</i>, respecting which there is
a great diversity of opinions. "If a gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
wishes to have plenty of wild-fowl on his pool,"
says Col. Hawker, in his <i>Instructions to Young
Sportsmen</i>, "let him preserve the coots and keep
no tame swans. The reason that all wild-fowls
seek the company of the coots is, because these
birds are such good sentries to give the alarm by
day when the fowl generally sleep." "If you wish
to have your water-fowl breed," says Captain
Mangles, "have no coots, for if you have they
will destroy all the eggs." Where there are
coots, and it is wished to destroy them, it is extremely
difficult to do so by shooting at them, as
the moment they see the gun, they dive into the
water, and when they come up again, are frequently
a hundred yards from the place where
they sank. They also make a great commotion
in the water by flapping their wings along its
surface, and making a tremendous rushing noise,
so that it is not very easy to approach them even
with a boat.</p>

<p>Almost every park where there are trees contains
<i>pheasants</i>; and in many places especial
contrivances have been resorted to for feeding and
keeping these birds. The places which they like
to frequent are woods and plantations where
there is plenty of undergrowth, and they are particularly
fond of places where fern and brake
grow abundantly. When it is wished to stock a
park with pheasants, it is usual to set the eggs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
under a common hen, and when they are hatched,
which will be in from twenty-three to twenty-seven
days, the young ones should be put into
a basket with a bit of flannel till the whole are
hatched and the shells have been removed from
the nest. They are then put back to the hen, and
fed with eggs boiled hard and then cut small, and
curd made by mixing new milk with the water in
which a lump of alum has been dissolved. They
should also have a few ants' eggs if they can be
procured, and, if they cannot, a raw egg should be
beaten up and mixed with as much flour as will
make it into a paste, and then rubbed through a
coarse sieve so as to leave it in little grains. Young
pheasants should be fed often, and have but a very
little at a time. When they are able to run about,
they are first put out with the hen under a coop like
chickens; but, when they get older and stronger,
the hen is put on one of the lower branches of the
tree in the poultry-yard, and tied to it by the leg,
so that she can move about on the branch, but
not descend to the ground; the young pheasants
seeing her on the tree will fly up to her, and thus
learn to perch. In a few days the hen is put
upon one of the higher branches of the tree, and
the young pheasants soon learn to follow her. In
a week or ten days after this, they are generally
old enough to leave the hen, and they may be
turned into the woods; though they will require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
feeding every morning and evening for some
weeks. Pheasants are naturally very shy, and
even when reared in this manner they become so
timid in the course of a few weeks that they will
not suffer any one to come near them. Many
persons suppose that, as they are natives of Asia
Minor, they are tender, and easily affected by the
cold; but this is not the case, as they will bear
cold better than most others of the feathered race.</p>

<p>Some persons try to fatten pheasants by putting
them in a small enclosure covered with a net;
but pheasants treated in this manner are never so
good as those shot wild in the woods.</p>

<p>Many plans have been devised for feeding pheasants
in the woods, but none are better than those
of Mr. Waterton at Walton Hall. At that most
interesting place, which may be called the paradise
of birds, Mr. Waterton has formed clumps of
hollies, by planting twenty or more in a circle,
and then making an inner circle, containing ten
or fifteen trees, and scattering the food for the
birds between the two circles, or in the centre of
the inner one. In other places a yew tree surrounded
by a holly hedge forms a place of shelter
for the birds; but the first kind is preferred for a
feeding-place. The pheasant requires a great
deal of food; and Mr. Waterton, whose knowledge
of the subject is proverbial, tells us that
"it is fond of acorns, beech mast, the berries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
the hawthorn, the seeds of the wild rose, and
the tubers of the Jerusalem artichoke. Boiled
potatoes (which the pheasant prefers much to
those in the raw state) are," he adds, "perhaps
the most nourishing things that can be offered in
the depth of winter." The plantations of hollies
afford the pheasant a retreat to feed in admirably
suited to its timid nature, and they serve at
the same time to keep the smaller birds at a
distance.</p>

<p>Pheasants are generally considered worth encouraging
in a park, for their ornamental effect
when sitting on the trees, or rising with a loud
whirr from their covers. It is also agreeable to
hear their call in the woods at roosting-time and
early in the morning. A wood without any
living creatures in it presents only a dreary scene,
or at best only gloomy pictures to the imagination;
but, as soon as it is instinct with life, its
whole aspect seems changed, and cheerful feelings
are excited. I like, therefore, to encourage birds
and other half wild animals in extensive parks,
and I would only banish those whose natural propensities
make their presence more likely to give
pain than pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Partridges</i> require very little aid from man,
provided only the common kind is desired. All
that is necessary is, to prevent the hen from being
disturbed while sitting, or while brooding over her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
young. May is the month in which the partridge
generally lays her eggs, and, from that time till
the end of June, care should be taken not to disturb
her. "Partridges pair early in spring, and
once united it is rare that any thing but death
separates them." The female lays from fourteen
to twenty eggs, and makes her nest upon the
ground. The young one runs as soon as it is
hatched, and frequently while it has still part of
the shell upon its head. The hen partridge rears
her young as a hen does her chickens, scratching
the ground to get insects for them, and sheltering
them under her wings while they are at rest.
Partridges succeed best in temperate climates;
for extremes of heat and cold are alike unfavourable
to them. Partridges make a peculiar noise
called jucking when they settle down for the
night; when this noise is heard, it is a certain
indication that there is a covey or brood of young
birds close at hand.</p>

<p>The <i>red-legged</i>, or <i>Guernsey, partridge</i> is very
abundant in France, and in many parts of the
Continent; but it is rare in England, except in
Suffolk, where it is not liked for the table. Its
habits differ materially from those of the common
partridge. It will only thrive in mountainous
situations covered with wood; and, instead of
roosting on the ground, it passes the night on
trees. It is also generally found perched on trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
in the daytime; and it lives in large flocks, and
not in coveys consisting only of a single family.
If you wish to try the experiment of rearing some
of these birds, you have only to get fifteen or
twenty of the eggs through some poulterer from
France or Guernsey, or from Suffolk, and to set
them under a common hen. They will be hatched
in about the same time as pheasants, and the
young birds require exactly the same treatment.</p>

<p>I do not think I need say any thing of the
other kinds of game birds common in England,
as you are not very likely to go out shooting;
and they are too wild to suffer themselves to be
approached.</p>

<p><i>Hares</i> may be occasionally seen lying in their
forms, or scudding across a field; but they are too
fond of pinks and carnations for me to be very
partial to them; and, indeed, it is hardly possible
to have a good flower-garden where there are a
great many hares and rabbits.</p>

<p><i>Herons</i> are very interesting birds, but, as they
only frequent marshy land, it is not every situation
that is suitable for them. They have certainly
a striking appearance in a landscape, when
they are seen standing for hours together on the
banks of a piece of water watching the fish; and,
when they fly, the flapping of their long wings,
and the cries they utter, have something in them
extremely wild and romantic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<p>The booming of the <i>bittern</i>, too, which is often
heard on the borders of marshy land, has a very
striking effect, and harmonises well with the cry
of the heron.</p>

<p>If you have any gold and silver pheasants, or
other curious birds that you do not like to trust
wild in the park, you will perhaps find it advantageous
to have an <i>aviary</i>; of which there are
two kinds. Small aviaries are, in fact, but birdcages
on a large scale, divided into compartments
to suit the nature of the birds that are to be confined
in them; while a large aviary is only a
superior kind of poultry-yard covered in with
wire network to prevent the birds from escaping.
The aviary of the Earl of Derby at Knowsley
Park, which is generally considered the best in
England, is of this latter description.</p>

<p>The <i>apiary</i>, or stand of beehives, should be
placed in a sheltered situation with a southerly
aspect, and care should be taken that there are
no bad smells near it; such, for instance, as those
proceeding from a pigsty or a dog-kennel. There
should, on the contrary, be a garden full of pleasant
flowers as near as possible to the bees, as,
though they will occasionally go even miles in
quest of food, it is much better for them on every
account to have it close at hand. Bees are particularly
fond of the flowers of buck-wheat, and,
though other plants may be more abundant in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
honey, none are more useful in affording what is
called bee-bread, or the substance on which the
bees live while they are laying up their winter
store. The working bees, indeed, manufacture
three distinct substances from the juices they obtain
from the flowers. These substances are, the
wax of which they make their combs; the honey
which they store in them, for consumption during
winter; and the bee-bread on which they feed,
and a portion of which they lay up in the cells in
which eggs are deposited, in order that the young
bee may feed upon it while in its larva state.</p>

<p>When you want to form an apiary, it is necessary
at first to decide upon what design you will prefer,
and then to adapt your bee-house to it; the bee-house
itself being a wooden closet with shelves in
it, each large enough to hold two or more hives.
The holes for the entrance of the bees must be in
front of the apiary; and they are generally made
three inches long, and a quarter of an inch high,
with a little shelf before each for the bees to alight
upon before they enter the hive. Many kinds of
hives have been recommended, and Nutt's hive is
a very good one, where the bees are kept merely
for an amusement, and it is wished to see them at
work; but, where honey is an object, I believe
the common straw hives are found to answer best.
I may observe, however, that where Nutt's hives
are used, no ornamental front is required to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
apiary, as the hives are quite sufficiently ornamental
in themselves.</p>

<p>When a hive of bees is to be bought, the person
who selects it generally taps it to see if it is full of
bees, and, if he is satisfied in this respect, a thin
board is slipped under it, and it is left quiet till
night. When it is dark, the board is gently
raised by having a person on each side of it, so as
to keep it as level as possible. A cloth is then
slipped under the board, and drawn up and tied
closely over the hive. When thus secured the
hive may be easily carried to any distance that
may be necessary; and, when it is placed on the
board where it is finally to stand, the cloth must
be taken away from the lower part of the hive
before it is placed; as, when it is once fixed, it
should not be moved again if it can possibly be
avoided.</p>

<p>In May or June bees generally swarm, that is,
the bees having become too numerous for the
hive, a portion of them go forth to seek a new
abode. A short time before swarming the bees
come out of their hive, and hang together so as
to form a chain. After hanging in this manner
for some time, and frequently for several hours,
they leave the old hive and settle on a tree in the
neighbourhood; and, as soon as this is the case, a
table is set under the tree covered with a white
cloth, and a man experienced in such matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
ascends the tree with an empty hive in his hand,
and sweeps the bees into it. He then brings the
hive down, and places it on the table which was
previously covered with a cloth. A very great
bustle immediately takes place among the bees,
and the cloth is completely covered with them.
Gradually, however, they become settled in the
hive, and at night the cloth may be drawn round
them, and the hive removed to wherever it may
be wished to place it. There must be one queen
bee in every swarm, and, if by any accident the
queen bee is killed, the remaining bees are in
the greatest trouble and confusion, as if seeking
for her, and if they do not find her they separate,
and disperse themselves among the other hives.
If, on the contrary, the queen is only held in confinement,
they fly to her as soon as they find out
where she is, and forming themselves into a chain,
wait till she comes forth to lead them away.</p>

<p>There are many curious facts relating to the
domestic economy of bees well worthy of your
notice, but this is not exactly the place to relate
them. I shall, therefore, only say a few words
on the mode of taking the honey, and on the
management of the bees during winter. Many
plans have been devised for taking the honey
without killing the bees; but this appears to be a
mistaken kind of humanity, as it is more merciful
to kill the bees at once than to condemn them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
die of starvation by depriving them of their winter
food. The ordinary mode is, to put linen rags
dipped in melted sulphur into a hole in the ground,
and, after having lighted them, to set a hive full of
bees over the hole. Another plan is to set the
full hive on an empty one inverted, and then to
introduce a sulphureous smoke into the full hive
by means of a pair of fumigating bellows. The
bees will all fall from the full hive into the empty
one, and the combs in the full hive, when cleared
of the bees, may be cut out. When the lives of
the bees are to be preserved, the full hive is inverted,
and the empty hive being put over it, and
both of them enclosed in a cloth, the lower hive is
tapped several times on the outside with a stick,
and gently shaken, so as to drive the bees from it
into the upper hive. A board is then slipped
between the two, and, the hive containing the
honeycombs being removed, the other hive is left
with the bees in it. This operation should be
performed in August, as, if it is later in the
season, the bees will not have time to provide
themselves with a fresh stock of honey before
winter. If the bees are to be destroyed when
the honey is taken, it is generally done in October.</p>

<p>When winter sets in many cover their hives
with a thatching of straw; and, if a few warm
days occur which tempt the bees out, they are
fed with sugar and water boiled into a syrup, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
not with merely sugar dissolved in water, as is
frequently the case. Some persons recommend
the syrup given to bees to be put on a plate and
crossed with straws, to enable the bees to take it
without drowning themselves; while others recommend
paper pierced with holes, or perforated
zinc, for the same purpose. It may be useful to
mention that the sting of a bee, being a powerful
acid, may be cured by the application of an alkali;
and thus chalk, or any similar substance, will very
soon allay the pain.</p>

<p>I shall now add a few words on keeping <i>silk-worms</i>,
and then I think I shall have said quite
enough on the animals usually kept in the country.
Silk-worms succeed best when fed on the
leaves of the white mulberry, but those of the
black mulberry are unwholesome for them. When
the leaves of the white mulberry cannot be procured,
lettuce leaves or those of the maclura are
the best substitute. Where the mulberry is
grown purposely for silk-worms, the trees are cut
down to the ground every year to make them
send up strong vigorous shoots. The leaves of
these shoots are gathered in the morning after the
dew has gone off, so that they may be perfectly
dry, and, when stripped off, they are deposited in
a bag kept open with a hoop round the top, in
order that they may be preserved in as fresh a
state as possible; and every leaf is taken off one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
tree before another is begun upon, as it is found
that this plan of stripping the trees entirely injures
them less than taking a few leaves from
each at a time; as, after the tree has been for
some time entirely denuded, it forms a fresh set
of leaf buds, and produces a second crop of leaves.
None of the leaves of this second crop, however,
must be taken off. Where labour is sufficiently
cheap, the leaves are best cut off with a pair of
scissors.</p>

<p>If you should feel inclined to try your skill in
feeding silk-worms, you can purchase the eggs in
Covent Garden market for ten shillings an ounce,
and, if kept in a cool place, they will remain good
for nearly a year. When they are to be hatched,
they must be exposed to a temperature of 86°
Fahr., and they are best kept in a room appropriated
for the purpose, and heated by a stove.
If you have any small room adjoining your
laundry, or any other place where there is a constant
fire, you will have no difficulty in managing
your silk-worms. Supposing you to have a room
of this nature, it will be well to have tables and
shelves provided for keeping the insects on; the
shelves should not be let into the wall, but should
be so contrived, by being suspended on holdfasts
or in some other way, as to have the air on every
side; and they should be furnished with ledges
round them to prevent the insects from falling off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the mulberry begins to unfold its
leaves, the eggs of the silk-worms should be laid
on the shelves, and when they begin to turn white,
which will be in about ten days if the room has
been kept at a proper temperature, they should
be covered over with little trays made of writing-paper
turned upside down, and pierced full of
holes with a large knitting-needle. On each tray
should be laid some young twigs of the mulberry,
which the insects will smell as soon as they are
hatched, and, crawling through the holes in the
paper, will begin to eat. As soon as a twig is
covered all over with silk-worms, it should be
carefully removed to another shelf, and the insects
placed on blotting-paper. Each insect should be
allowed about a square inch of paper. It should
then be fed with chopped leaves, and it will appear
to pass the greater part of its time in sleep till it
changes its skin. In its second state it will also
appear to pass a great portion of its time in sleep;
but it may be fed with young leaves without
chopping, till it changes its skin a second time.
In its third state the silk-worm becomes more
lively and vigorous, and it will devour full-grown
leaves without chopping. Up to this period of
its life it will be sufficient to feed it three times a
day. After changing its skin a third time, the
silk-worm becomes of a flesh colour, and eats so
greedily that it should be kept supplied with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
succession of leaves all day long. After the next
change the silk-worm eats abundantly night and
day, and should be kept warm. It now begins to
get restless, and instead of eating is continually
stretching out its head as though it were in search
of something; its body will have become transparent,
of a clear pearly hue, with bands of gold
colour. Little bits of wood should now be fixed
on the shelves in such a way as to give the insects
a feeling of security; and they will immediately
begin to make their cocoons, which they will
complete in from four to seven days.</p>

<p>When the insects have done working, the cocoons
are taken from the sticks, and a few being selected
to breed from, the rest are prepared for unwinding.
The insects enclosed are first killed, either
by putting them in bags and enclosing them for
half an hour in an oven heated to 88°; or by
putting them in sieves, and, after covering them
closely with a woollen cloth, placing the sieves
over boiling water or boiling spirits of any kind.
The insects being killed, the loose or floss silk is
removed from the cocoons, and they are put by
handfuls into basins of hot water, which has been
heated almost to the boiling point; and the cocoons
are stirred round in it for a few minutes
with a whisk of broom. In a very short time the
gum with which the insect had covered the cocoon
is dissolved, and the loose threads beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
float on the water, five or six of them are collected,
and the reeling of the silk begins. If well fed and
kept in a proper temperature, the caterpillars will
finish their labours twenty-four days after they
are hatched. An ounce of eggs will produce
about forty thousand caterpillars, which will consume
nearly eleven hundred pounds of leaves,
and will produce about eighty pounds of cocoons, or
eight pounds of raw silk.</p>

<p>It gives me the greatest pleasure, my dear Annie,
to find that you are entering so warmly into
country pursuits, and I have read over repeatedly
the passage in which you thank me for having
taught you to love the country, and in which you
say that when you look at your beautiful garden
(now so brilliant with bright scarlet verbenas and
golden-yellow calceolarias, that you can scarcely
gaze at it in the sunshine), and that when you sit
in your light cheerful room, or wander near the
house, and see in one direction the village church
peeping through the trees, and in another a river
winding like a silver riband through the valley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
you can scarcely believe it is the same place as
that which struck you as the very palace of
gloominess only a few months ago. "The very
rooms themselves seem changed," you add, "and
even the situation of the house; for, instead of
being buried in a deep valley, and surrounded
by a thick forest which rose on every side as if to
entomb it, and which appeared to forbid the possibility
of walking out, it is now every thing I
could desire, and I would not alter it even if I had
Aladdin's lamp."</p>

<p>I am not, however, quite so well pleased to find
that it is several weeks since you have been
beyond the precincts of what you call your own
domain; that is, the garden, poultry-yard, &amp;c.,
immediately adjoining the house. It is well to
love home, and to take a deep interest in all relating
to it; but it is not well to live entirely in
so confined a sphere. The mind indeed becomes
contracted by dwelling only on a limited number
of objects, and those all in what may be called an
artificial state; while, on the contrary, it is expanded,
and noble feelings are elicited, by communion
with nature. "I have been talking to
the vines," said the great Goethe after paying a
visit to the country, "and you cannot think what
beautiful things they have said to me." Seek
nature then, my dear Annie; leave your trim
flower-garden, and your tame poultry, and wander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
in the woods, admiring the poetry of forest scenery,
and watching the habits of the various creatures
which people what seems to the careless observer
only one vast solitude.</p>

<p>You must not suppose, however, that I want
you to set forth like a female knight-errant in
quest of adventures; but I do think that attended
by your maid, who I was glad to hear is
a highly respectable and well-educated young
woman, you may wander through the woods of
your own park without incurring any very serious
dangers.</p>

<p>In the first place, however, I would advise
you to provide yourself with a pair of strong and
yet comfortable boots. I prefer German boots
made to tie round the ankles, so that they can
be easily taken off when you come home with
them dirty; as it is not very agreeable, when you
are tired, to wait till your boots are unlaced before
you can enjoy the comfort of clean dry shoes after
a fatiguing walk. If you can walk in clogs comfortably
they will keep you very dry, as two
pairs of even thin soles admit less damp to the feet
than one pair of thick ones. I do not, however,
think you will find clogs advisable, unless you walk
to church, or to make calls, as they fatigue the
feet exceedingly by their irregular pressure; and,
while Indian rubber clogs make the feet cold by
preventing the evaporation of the insensible perspiration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
the jointed clogs may very probably break
at a considerable distance from the house, and
reduce you to the disagreeable necessity of walking
home in thin shoes through the mud. When you
lived in town I remember you were not capable
of bearing much fatigue, and though I have no
doubt but the country air has greatly invigorated
you, yet I think you will find it advisable to let
your maid carry a camp stool with you in your
excursions, as nothing can be more injurious to a
person of delicate constitution than over-fatigue.</p>

<p>In the course of your walks, you will doubtless
find many situations where a rustic seat might be
introduced advantageously. I do not mean one
of those distorted chairs or garden-seats made of
crooked pieces of wood nailed together in the
strangest possible shapes and then painted and varnished,
but a real rustic seat formed by the stump
of an old tree or the trunk of a fallen one, only
made sufficiently smooth to prevent it from tearing
your clothes; or, at most, only a few plain pieces
of wood nailed together by some village workman,
and placed under the spreading branches of a
tree, so as to be not at all obtrusive.</p>

<p>When you first begin to walk out you will
probably find the beauty of the scenery quite sufficient
to interest you; but after a time, as your
walks must all necessarily partake of the same
character, you will want a little variety, and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
must make sources of interest to yourself by
observing the various natural objects you meet
with, and when you come home endeavouring
to make yourself acquainted with some particulars
respecting them. To illustrate what I
mean by an example, I will just enumerate the
objects you may very probably meet with in a
morning's walk, and show you how much entertainment
you may derive from them.</p>

<p>I will suppose first, that you see a mole-hill
with a mole caught and hanging in a trap near it.
Struck with the curious form of the mole, its long
snout, its hands, and its velvet fur, and your curiosity
being excited to know something of its
habits, you write the word "mole" in your notebook.
A little farther on, you see a rather small
bird, with a dead mouse in its beak almost as large
as itself, dash the mouse violently against the
branch of a tree, and leave it there sticking in
the fork of the branch. This appears so strange
that you approach the branch to examine it, and
find on another branch an insect completely
impaled on a twig, which apparently some boy
has forced through its body. Shuddering at
the cruelty of human nature you walk on; but
shortly afterwards perceiving a curious excrescence
on the trunk of a tree, which is almost
above your reach, you stand to look at it, and see
to your astonishment some other insects impaled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
in the same manner as the first, at a height no
boy could reach; and, quite puzzled, you enter a
note in your journal. A little farther on, you meet
with a black snail that crawls across your path,
and leaves a long line of shining slime behind;
and you then find some
curious little fungi (fig.
18.) which look like
fairy birds' nests full
of eggs. Your attention
is next attracted
by a plant with a square
stem, and soft hairy leaves, heart-shaped at the
base, and tapering to the point; and very pretty
spotted pink flowers, something like those of the
snapdragon, but much smaller. You afterwards
pick up a bit of stone that appears composed of
various particles; and, lastly, as you go home you
observe the singular appearance of the clouds,
which look like long plumes of feathers streaming
in the wind. You make notes of all that you
have seen, and when you get home amuse yourself
by searching in books for an explanation of
those subjects which have excited your curiosity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/fig_18.jpg" width="200" alt="wood engraving" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 18. <i>Nidulària campanulàta.</i></div>
</div>

<p>First, if you will look for the article Mole in
Bell's <i>British Quadrupeds</i>, you will find an engraving
of the curious little hands, or rather paws,
by which the mole makes its passages through the
earth, with a plan of its castle under ground; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
you will read a description of the little animal
itself, and of its fur which is set horizontally from
its skin, so as not to offer any obstruction in the
narrow passages through which it moves, sometimes
forward and sometimes backward. You will
also read an account of the ingenious experiment
of M. Henri Le Court, who, to discover how fast
a mole could go, fixed straws in the track of the
mole's burrow; and then, blowing a horn at the
entrance, counted with what rapidity the different
straws were thrown down, and calculated that
a mole can run as fast as a horse can trot. The
whole account is extremely curious; and I am
quite sure, when you have read it, you will feel
an interest in moles that you have never had before;
and that you will look with quite different
feelings at every mole-hill that you may see.</p>

<p>The next thing you saw was a bird hanging a
field-mouse upon the fork of a branch, and near
it you saw several insects impaled upon twigs,
too high for it to have been the work of a mischievous
boy. The bird you saw was the Greater
Shrike, or butcher bird, whose habit it is to hang
up the insects or small animals it kills as a butcher
does the meat in his stall, and afterwards to return
to feed upon them. You will find accounts
of this curious bird in Yarrell's <i>British Birds</i>;
Montagu's <i>Ornithological Dictionary</i>; and the
<i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>, under the article Shrike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<p>You will next find entered in your journal the
creature called a black snail, but which is in fact
a slug, as it has no visible shell. On looking for
the word Slug in the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i> you will
find yourself referred to Limax, and under that
head you will find a figure very nearly resembling
the creature you are seeking for, though it differs
in colour; as it is called Arìon rùfa, or the red
slug, while the creature you saw was the black
slug, called Arìon àter; and if you have the courage
to examine the living animal you will find it
very curiously formed. Its back is covered with
a black ribbed skin, and on the upper part it
bears a shield, which consists of a piece of bone,
the only one in the slug's body, covered with
skin; the shield being designed to protect the
air-hole through which the creature breathes.
What we are accustomed to call its horns are,
in fact, tentacula or feelers, which the creature
has the power of drawing into its body or pushing
out at pleasure, and which are gifted with an exquisitely
fine sense of touch. The long shining
line with which the creature marked its path is
the slime which proceeds from its body, and with
which it is enabled to glide smoothly over sand or
gravel that would otherwise injure it. I have
said more on this subject than I should otherwise
have done, because I wish to point out to you
that even a creature so humble and so despicable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
as a slug, is as curiously and wonderfully made,
and displays the power and wisdom of its Creator,
as decidedly, as the noblest and most beautiful
animal. The study of natural history is, indeed,
I think, more fitted than any other to open our
minds to a proper knowledge of the wisdom and
goodness of God; and the more we study it the
more firmly we shall be convinced that nothing
has been made in vain, and that everything has
been most admirably suited to the station which
it is destined to fill.</p>

<p>The curious fungus you will find, by comparing
it with the <i>Encyclopædia of Plants</i>, is Nidulària
campanulàta, which the Scotch call "Siller Cups."
There is a popular superstition in Scotland respecting
these pretty little cups, which says that
if you find them alone you will have as much
money as they contain little balls. These balls
are, however, cases containing the sporules, or
seeds, of the fungus.</p>

<p>I now come to the flower which I have supposed
to have attracted your attention, and you
will find, upon a minute examination, that it has a
corolla divided into two distinct parts, the upper
one standing up like a hood or helmet, and the
lower one hanging down like a pouting under lip.
It is this last which gives you a clue to find out
what the plant is, as you perceive immediately
that it belongs to the Labiàtæ, or lipped plants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
You may then turn to any work you may possess
on the British wild flowers, when, if the text
is arranged according to the natural system, you
will find your plant under the head of Labiàtæ,
and, if the work has coloured plates, you will
recognise it without any further trouble; but, if
the work has no plates, you must endeavour to
identify it by the description, and finding your
plant has a square solid stem, soft, hairy, heart-shaped
leaves, which taper gradually to a point,
and that the lower lip of the flower, which is
much larger than the helmet, is spotted, you
discover that the plant agrees in description
with the common woundwort (<i>Stàchys sylvática</i>.)
If you want to find it in Sowerby's <i>English
Botany</i>, you had better take the second edition
of that work, where you will find the plant in
question in the Linnæan class and order Didynàmia
Gymnospérmia, from two of the stamens
being longer than the others, and the seeds being
what is called naked, that is, not enclosed in any
visible pod or other seed-vessel. This will appear
difficult to you at first; but, as I think you
have told me that your husband understands
botany, it will be an amusement to him to explain
to you at his convenience the principles both of
the Linnæan and the natural systems, and to leave
you to make a practical application of them in
your morning walks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing can be more delightful than to study
a science in this manner. It is pleasing to be
schooled by the lips of those we love, and the
wish to prove yourself deserving of the pains your
master takes with you, will make you exert yourself
to conquer any little difficulty you may meet
with; while, on the other hand, your husband
will be proud of the proficiency of his pupil, and a
new occupation will be given to you, which will prevent
your conversations becoming so monotonous
as those of two persons who live together, and
who see few strangers, would otherwise inevitably
become. One of the great secrets for enabling a
woman to render her husband happy, and, of
course, to be happy herself, is partaking with him
as much as possible in both his amusements and
his studies. A woman should have as many subjects
of interest as possible in common with her
husband; and, in fact, she should have no objects
of interest in the cares for which he cannot participate.
It is true that in her domestic occupations
she must be employed differently from him,
as a man cannot interfere in the details of household
arrangements; but a good wife will always
have her husband's comfort in view, even when
she is attending to her store-room or her kitchen;
and she will be proud to show him the result of
her labours in their due season. Men also have
duties to attend to in which a woman cannot participate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
such as those of a justice of the peace;
and some manly sports, such as shooting and
hunting. But these will often supply subjects
for conversation, and afford that variety which
gives life its greatest charm. It is, indeed, better
that married people should have separate occupations
during a part of the day; but they should
never have separate interests, and they should
always study to have as many subjects in common
as possible.</p>

<p>But I am forgetting that you have still two
objects of natural history to be explained, which
excited your attention during your walk. The
first is the piece of stone that was picked up, and
which, from the numerous particles it contains,
was probably a piece of Granite, that is to say, if
shining particles were mixed with others of a different
nature; and it will be an amusement to
you if you have any mineralogical specimens, to
endeavour to find out what it is by comparing it
with them; or, if you have not, to take it with
you the first time you go to a town where there is
a museum. The curious appearance you noticed in
the clouds you will find, by consulting a book on
meteorology, was of the kind called Cirrus, or,
popularly, mare's tail, and that it is said to indicate
the approach of windy weather.</p>

<p>It would be useless to multiply instances of the
mode in which an interest may be created in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
country walks; but what I have said will be sufficient
to show that, though we may complain of
the monotony of a country life, there are a thousand
sources of interest in it within our reach, if
we will only give ourselves the trouble to observe
them.</p>

<p>Now that the autumn is rapidly advancing, you
should begin to think of those amusements which
more properly belong to the season; especially as
you are expecting soon to receive a visit from
your sisters, and as you will, of course, be anxious
to afford them as many amusements while they
stay with you as possible.</p>

<p><i>Archery</i> is a favourite amusement with ladies
in the country, as few exercises display an elegant
form to more advantage. The first thing that is
to be done is to choose a suitable piece of ground;
and, as most old houses have a piece of ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
which was used as a bowling-green, I have no
doubt yours has one which will be quite suitable
for the purpose. The ground having been chosen,
the next thing is to set up a target, and the next
to provide proper bows and arrows, bracers, and
shooting-gloves.</p>

<p>The <i>target</i> is generally made of wisps of straw
tied together at intervals, and then wound round
and round, like an old-fashioned door-mat, only
round instead of oval, till of the proper size.
This straw framework is covered with canvass
or leather, painted with rings of different colours,
first green, then white, then black, then white,
and then a very broad ring of dark red, in the
centre of which is a gilt spot called the bull's eye.
Other targets are made of a hoop or circular frame
of wood, with a piece of leather stretched over it,
painted in rings and with a bull's eye in the centre,
like the common kinds; and others are square,
and made of iron for firing against with bullets.
In all cases the target stands on three legs, in a
slanting direction, and the merit of the shooter is
estimated by the nearness with which the arrow,
or ball, approaches the centre.</p>

<p>Modern <i>bows</i> are of two kinds, viz. self bows
and backed bows. The self bow is composed of
only one kind of wood; but the backed bow is
composed of two kinds of wood, both the full
length of the bow, carefully joined together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
Bows used formerly to be made of the yew, and
foreign yew was preferred to British, as being
more elastic. Now the yew is seldom used, and
bows are made, either wholly or in part, of ornamental
woods, such as fustick, lance-wood, or
partridge-wood, backed by ash or elm. Bows are
of different lengths, but those for ladies are generally
about five feet long; while men, on the
contrary, generally choose a bow of their own
height. The strength of a bow is calculated by
the weight that it requires to be suspended to the
bowstring, when the bow is strung, to draw the
string to the length of an arrow from the bow,
and this is called the bow's weight. Fifty pounds
is the standard weight of a man's bow, and it requires
a very strong man to draw a bow of sixty
pounds' weight; but bows for ladies and children
are from two to thirty pounds' weight. The bow
handle, that is, the part which is nearly in the
centre of the bow, is usually covered with velvet,
in order to give a firm hold without hurting the
hands; and this handle is placed, not exactly in
the centre, but below it, so as to shorten the lower
branch, as the strain upon that part is generally
considered greater than on the other, and on this
account, also, the lower part of the bow is generally
the thickest and the strongest. The two ends of
the bow are tipped with horn, and notches are
made in these tippings to receive the bowstring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<p>The best <i>bowstrings</i> are made of Italian hemp,
dressed with gum or Indian glue to preserve them
from the wet; and the distance of the string from
the centre of the bow, when strung, should not be
more than five inches for a bow five feet long,
and in the largest bows not more than six.</p>

<p>An <i>arrow</i>, in the language of the bow-maker,
consists of three parts; the shaft or stele, the head
or pile, and the feather. The best wood for the
shaft of an arrow is the ash, and the next best the
birch or hornbeam. The aspen and the lime are
also used; but deal or willow-wood is too light,
and the arrows made of these woods have an uncertain
wavering flight. The length of the arrow
should be regulated by that of the bow, and for
bows of five feet in length arrows of two feet are
generally used, their length increasing in proportion
to that of the bow. When arrows are intended
for a long flight, they are generally thickest
directly under the feathers, and taper gradually
to the pile. The nock of the arrow was formerly
made of solid horn; but it is now merely inlaid.
It should be as nearly as possible the size of the
string, so that it may fit closely, and yet not require
force to fix it. The feather is a most important
part of the arrow, as without that the
arrow will not fly steadily. Every arrow has
three feathers, and the colour of one of them,
which is sometimes termed the cock-feather, is
generally different from that of the other two; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
this feather must always be uppermost, when the
arrow is placed on the string. Should, however,
the feathers be all of the same colour, that one is
considered the cock-feather which is on the horn
of the nock. After the feathers are fixed on the
arrow they are generally covered with gum water,
not made too strong, to give them firmness and to
make their flight more steady.</p>

<p>The <i>bracer</i> is a piece of stout polished leather,
which is buckled round the arm which holds the
bow, to prevent the string from hurting it when
it is let go. Even with that precaution, the string
very often bruises the arm, and ladies sometimes
have the bracer wadded, or lined with India rubber
to make it more elastic, and thus to diminish
the force of the rebound.</p>

<p>The <i>shooting-glove</i> consists of three finger-stalls
made of very strong, but yet pliable leather. It
is worn over an ordinary glove, and is fastened
round the wrist by a button or string.</p>

<p>The <i>belt</i> and <i>tassel</i> complete the equipments.
The first buckles round the waist, and has a pouch
for holding the arrows fixed to it on the right
side, while on the left is the tassel, which is used
for wiping the heads of the arrows when they have
entered the ground. Ladies very often omit the
belt, as they have generally some person in attendance
on them to supply them with arrows,
and to pick up and wipe those they have the misfortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
to let enter the ground. I say misfortune,
for all arrows that do not reach the target are
considered of no avail.</p>

<p>The distance at which the archer stands from
his mark depends upon circumstances; but the
ordinary distance for ladies is a hundred yards. A
flat stone is often let into the ground to show where
the archer is to stand, and then the target is
moved to the distance that may be agreed upon.
The bow is held in the left hand, and the string
is pulled by the right. Arrows were formerly
reckoned by the sheaf, which consisted of twenty-four
arrows, which were carried in a quiver or
arrow-case on the back; but arrows for immediate
use were always worn in the girdle. When a
portion of the English soldiers were archers, every
full-grown man was forbidden by statute to shoot
at a butt which was nearer to him than two
hundred and twenty yards; and the archers drew
their bowstrings to the ear instead of to the
breast, as is the custom at the present time.
Newington Butts, and several other places round
London, bear witness by their names to their
having been formerly places for the citizens to
exercise their skill in archery; but even as late
as the reign of Elizabeth no person was allowed to
shoot with a yew bow, under the age of seventeen,
unless he was the son of a gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Sketching</i> in the open air is a very delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
country amusement, particularly when it can be
so managed as to be done with very little apparatus.
To go out with a table and chair and
every thing prepared is, however, enough to damp
the courage of an amateur artist; and nearly all
the pleasure of sketching from nature depends
upon being able to gratify the inspiration of the
moment, at the very moment when the desire to
make a sketch is felt. There are happy moments
in which the talents appear to have more brilliancy
than at other times, and, as these do not
depend upon the will of the poet or the artist,
they must be taken advantage of when they arise,
or they are lost.</p>

<p>As I know you have an admirable talent for
sketching from nature, and as I have no doubt
there are some noble specimens of trees in a park
so old as yours is, I would advise you by all
means to provide yourself with what is called a
block-book, that is, a drawing-book in which the
sheets of paper are fixed together by a little gum,
or some other glutinous substance, being washed
over the edges, so that they are as perfectly firm
and solid as though the whole book were a block
of wood with a piece of paper pasted on it. It is
obvious that a book of this kind may be held in
one hand, and a drawing made upon it with the
other, without requiring any table; and, when
the drawing is finished, it may be detached by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
putting the thumb-nail in the little hollow left
on one side for that purpose, and separating that
one sheet of paper from the rest. After which,
the drawing may be put into a flap or pocket provided
for that purpose in the cover of the book;
while the next sheet is left ready for another
drawing to be made upon it. A book of this
kind is not larger than a thin octavo, and it may
be easily carried by your maid in her reticule
without any parade, as, if it should not be wanted,
it will be of very little incumbrance; whereas, if
you have a table and the apparatus for drawing
carried out, and should not happen to be visited
by the pictorial muse, you will find it very disagreeable
to be joked on so formidable a preparation
having produced no result. Even under
the most favourable circumstances, it is much
more agreeable to draw from nature in a block-book
than in any other way, as ordinary sheets of
paper are always being curled up and moved
about by the wind. You will also find it advantageous
to supply yourself with one of those pencils
with a broad lead which are sold for sketching
foliage, and you will find it save both time and
trouble to take a case of pencils out with you, with
pencils of different degrees of fineness cut for
use.</p>

<p>Should you wish to give the effect of colour
to your landscapes, you will do well to provide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
yourself with an artist's colour-box made of tin,
with a place for the colours to be rubbed on inside
of the lid; and provided with a small bottle
for containing water. When you sketch, be particular
in marking strongly the effects of light
and shade, and the distances; also pay particular
attention to giving the proper touch to the different
trees. The foliage of the pine and fir tribe
is characterised by a few small upright strokes introduced
occasionally; the oak requires angular
touches, and has a certain degree of squareness in
the outline of its twigs; the elm has a roundness
in the touch; the touch of the willow is thin and
wiry; and that of alder somewhat heart-shaped.
It is difficult to explain what I mean without the
aid of drawings; but your best way will be to get
some good sketches of trees, and then to take them
out with you, and compare them with the effects
you observe in nature.</p>

<p>A <i>swing</i> is a very useful adjunct to the amusements
of the country, as many grown-up people
are as fond of swinging as children. The most
simple kind of swing is formed by tying the two
ends of a strong rope to the branches of two trees
which may chance to be conveniently placed for
the purpose, the rope having been previously
passed through two holes in a piece of flat board,
which serves for the seat. A swing of this kind
requires no attention but turning the seat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
wrong way upwards in wet weather, and taking
the rope down in autumn, as it will become rotten
from exposure to the wet during winter. The
seat should also have two strips of wood nailed on
its under side, across the grain of the wood, in
order to prevent it from splitting open, which it
would otherwise be very likely to do, from being
exposed to the alternations of wet and dry weather.
Where there are no trees conveniently situated
for a swing, two upright pieces of wood may be
driven into the ground, with hooks or rings affixed
to the upper part, to which other hooks are attached
that have been previously fastened to the
ends of a strong piece of rope. A swing of this
kind is generally furnished with a chair or boat,
and it is more fitted for a court or some piece of
enclosed ground than for the open pleasure-ground.
At the Duke of Devonshire's, at Chiswick, a hammock
is hung between two trees for the purpose
of a swing.</p>

<p>If you have a <i>boat</i> on your water, take care,
when it is chained up in the boat-house, that it
floats in water, and does not lie in mud. Pleasure-boats
should be painted every year, and always be
kept perfectly clean and dry in the inside. They
should never be exposed for any length of time to
the heat of the sun, and if the smallest opening is
perceived it should be mended immediately. Great
care should be taken, in a small pleasure-boat, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
stand up as seldom as possible; and never to be
tempted by the wish of seeing any particular object,
to rush suddenly from one side of the boat to
the other.</p>

<p><i>Skating</i> is a winter amusement, but it is a very
healthy one, and one in which a lady can, without
any impropriety, indulge. The principal thing to
be attended to, after having provided yourself
with a pair of good skates, is to learn to balance
yourself properly first on one foot, and then on
the other. When you first begin to move, you
will find it very difficult to avoid falling the
moment you attempt to move one foot without
the other; and it will probably be all you can do
to keep yourself erect, even if you slide awkwardly
along with both heels close together. When you
do venture to separate your feet, you must contrive
to balance your body so as to keep your ankles
directly over your skates, and not to suffer the
skates to bend under them in a slanting direction.
When you see experienced skaters with the steel
part of their skates cutting the ice in a slanting
direction, you will observe that their skates only
follow the same inclination as their bodies, and
that the steel of the skate is still exactly under
the ankle of the foot. When you begin to skate
properly, the leg that is upon the ice should be
kept quite straight and the weight of the body
thrown upon it, while the other leg should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
kept straight also, but in a slanting direction, and
with the toe pointing downwards. It is well not
to look at either the ice or the feet, but to keep
the face erect and looking forwards. When persons
first begin to skate they balance themselves
with their arms almost involuntarily, and, when
one foot is off the ice, they raise up the arm on
the opposite side to prevent themselves from
falling. This is excusable in a beginner; but, as
it has an inelegant appearance, the habit of doing
so should be shaken off as soon as possible. The
best way is to fold the arms across the breast, or
to carry the hands in a muff. The greatest care
ought to be paid to carrying the body gracefully
and elegantly, and avoiding all sudden jerks.
Skilful skaters make the figure of eight or the
cross-roll, as it is called, with the greatest facility;
but figure-skating is rather the accomplishment of
a gentleman than a lady, who should be contented
to glide gracefully and easily along.</p>

<p>I believe I have now mentioned most of the
ordinary kinds of country amusements in which
a lady can properly indulge; as I must confess
I should not like to see you hunting or coursing,
though I have heard of some ladies doing so.
It is quite natural that a lady should like to see
the hounds throw off, as nothing can be more
animating than such a scene; but that is, I think,
all that can be allowed. As, however, your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
husband is most probably fond of sporting, it may
be as well to mention a few of the terms used by
sportsmen when speaking of the chase, that you
may understand what is meant, if your husband
should give you any account of the day's sport,
without troubling him by asking continual explanations.
When sportsmen are speaking of dogs,
they say a brace of greyhounds if they mean two,
or a leash if they mean three; but they say a
couple of hounds, or a couple and a half if they
mean three. In speaking of a fox-chase, they
say they have unkenneled a fox when they have
merely found a wild one. A sharp burst is when
the hounds go off very fast at first; but a check
is when they lose the scent. If the fox is by any
accident turned back, he is said to be headed.
The place where the fox is likely to be found is
called the cover, and when the hounds are taken
into it to try if they can find the fox, they are
said to be drawing the cover. The scent left by
the fox is called the drag. When the hounds find
the scent they generally utter a cry, which is
called giving tongue; and when the whole pack
go off after the fox, uttering this sound, they are
said to be in full cry. The foot of the fox is
called the pad, and his tail the brush. Some
sportsmen, instead of saying a pack of fox-hounds,
say a kennel, and only say a pack of harriers, or a
pack of beagles; the latter being a very small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
kind of harrier. In hare-hunting, sportsmen say
they have started the hare from her form, when
they have found one. When a hare returns to
the place from which she started, it is said she
doubles. The tail of the hare is called the scut,
and that of the dog is sometimes called the stern;
but this last term, I believe, only relates to dogs
used in hunting.</p>

<p>You will observe, my dear Annie, that though
I have mentioned a few sporting terms, with the
meanings that are, I believe, generally assigned to
them, I would advise you never to make use of
them in conversation; as nothing can be more
unfeminine than for a woman to use terms only
adapted to manly amusements. I am sure your
husband would dislike to hear you ape the sportsman;
as men, with very few exceptions, always
feel disgust at a masculine woman.</p>

<h4>LETTER XIX.</h4>

<h5>RELATION BETWEEN A LANDED PROPRIETOR AND THE COTTAGERS
ON HIS ESTATE.&mdash;HOW TO RELIEVE THE POOR.&mdash;ESTABLISHING
SCHOOLS.&mdash;TEACHING THE DAUGHTERS
OF THE POOR TO MAKE CLOTHES, AND TEACHING THEM
COOKING.&mdash;EMPLOYING THE POOR.&mdash;ASSISTING THE POOR
IN ILLNESS.&mdash;MAKING CLOTHES FOR THE POOR.</h5>


<p>I have now, my dear Annie, a few words to say
on a more important subject than those I have yet
touched upon; I mean the duties which are imposed
upon you by your residence in the country.
As your husband is the last descendant of an
ancient family, it is particularly incumbent upon
him, and, of course, also upon you, to keep up as
much as possible the kindly feeling which existed
in the olden time between the lords of the soil and
its cultivators, but which has, of late years, been
too much neglected. The proprietor of a large
estate ought to be regarded by the labouring cottagers
in the light of a protector, to whom they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
can look up for advice and assistance in their
troubles; and as a friend upon whose kindness
they may confidently rely, and who they know
will be interested in their welfare. When this is
the case, the tenantry of a country gentleman will
form his best body-guard; and, instead of ever
attempting to injure his property, they will do all
in their power to protect it.</p>

<p>I think it highly desirable that you should
be personally acquainted with the poor people
in the vicinity of your husband's mansion, that
you may know how to afford them the most
acceptable assistance, and who are most deserving
of it. For this reason, I think you should occasionally
walk through the village, instead of confining
your rambles exclusively to the park, and
call frequently on your poorer neighbours; not
with the apparent wish of dictating to them how
they should live, and how they should manage
their families, but with the ostensible purpose
of employing them in some little work, and in
reality to see how you can best be serviceable
to them, and how you can do them the most
positive good. It is the blessed privilege of
wealth and rank that they give us the power of
making our fellow-creatures happy, with very
trifling inconvenience to ourselves. A word or a
kind look from the rich to the poor speaks
volumes, and carries with it encouragement and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
pleasure, which no efforts of persons in their own
rank in life can give. It is, however, difficult for
the rich to know how to be of real service to the
poor, as giving alms seldom does good except in
cases of sudden and unforeseen distress. The
best charity is first to teach the poor how to maintain
themselves, and next to give them employment;
and when they have this, they have a
better chance of happiness than any riches could
bestow combined with idleness. Perhaps, indeed,
there is no state of existence more happy than
that of a person who is usefully and profitably
employed, and whose employment is of such a
nature as to exercise moderately the faculties
both of the body and the mind.</p>

<p>Establishing schools is an important duty which
the rich owe to the poor. Every girl ought to be
able to sew neatly and well, and to read, write,
and keep accounts. I think also it would be a
great advantage if all the girls who have attained
the age of fourteen were to receive a few lessons
in dress-making, and making waistcoats and boys'
clothes, from the regular mantua-maker and tailor
of the village; or you might pay for this out of
your own pocket, and make it a reward for good
conduct. It is particularly useful to the wife of
a labouring man to know how to cut out and
make or alter clothes, as work of this kind can be
taken up and laid down while the mother is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
nursing her children, or watching the boiling of a
pot, or some similar kind of simple cookery.</p>

<p>Many poor women waste a great deal of food by
not knowing how to use it to the best advantage;
for instance, they often throw away the water in
which meat has been boiled, and of which an
excellent soup might be made by the addition of
a few vegetables, and thickening it with oatmeal,
flour, or pearl barley; and they sometimes
spoil meat, when they have it, by letting it boil
so fast as to become hard and indigestible. I
do not mean, by making these observations, that
I think you should make inquiries into what
your poor neighbours have for dinner, or how
they cook their food, as there are no points
on which the poor generally dislike to be interfered
in more than these; but I only mean that
you should, if possible, get the daughters taught
the best way of cooking food suitable to their
rank in life, by some experienced person, and that
then it should be left for the mothers to adopt
these new plans or not, as they liked.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, I would not have you too
fond of offering to have the daughters of the
cottagers taught any thing by your own servants.
The modes of living of the rich and the poor are
necessarily so different, that a cottager's daughter
would reap very little advantage from seeing how
the dishes were prepared for your table, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
she might be rendered discontented by observing
the very great difference between the mode of
living in your kitchen and in her own cottage.
There are, however, exceptions to this rule, in the
case of girls who wish to become servants; and,
whenever that happens, I would advise you always
to have the girls sent to the mansion-house, to be
placed under the direction of the servant in whose
department she might wish to be employed.</p>

<p>Before commencing your visits to the poor, I
would advise you to inquire in what way you can
best afford them employment; for instance, in
your neighbourhood, I believe, the country people
employ themselves generally in making lace;
knowing this, you could not do better, when
calling upon some of the cottagers, than to give
an order for lace, and in doing so you might enter
into conversation with them about their patterns,
the length of time they have been employed in the
business, and a variety of other topics which will
suggest themselves naturally. This will deprive
your visit of the painful feeling which would have
attended it if you had called without any direct
object in view, and it will give you an opportunity
of becoming acquainted with the different members
of the family, and seeing whether there are
any too young or too old to work in the same
manner as the others, and for whom you may
possibly be able to find fitting employment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>Plaiting coarse straw or bulrushes is an employment
that can be followed both by old people and
young children; and you will find covers made of
straw plaited into bands, and then sown together,
of great service in protecting your half-hardy
plants during frosty weather. Garden mats,
baskets for flowers, and various other things, may
be made in the same manner, and you will easily
find out what will be most suitable to your <i>protégées</i>,
and what they can do with least difficulty
to themselves.</p>

<p>In cases of illness, I am sure you will be happy
to assist your poor neighbours in every way in
your power. When poor people are ill their
means of support are stopped, and they have not
only to labour through the pains of illness, but
they are also exposed to the greatest privations for
the want of food, at the very moment when food
of a more nourishing nature than usual is required
for them. Then it is that the helping hand of
the rich is of the greatest value to the poor, and
that charity takes its most graceful form.</p>

<p>Many ladies in the country employ a portion of
their time in making clothes for the poor; but
with the exception of permitting young people to
make baby-linen, I question whether it is advisable
that much should be done in this way.
The feelings of the poor are often hurt by having
it dictated to them what they are to wear, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
they are apt to look upon the clothes thus given
to them, and which are probably quite different
from what they would have purchased for themselves,
almost as a badge of slavery which they
are compelled to wear to please their patrons, but
of which they hate the very sight.</p>

<p>And now, my dear Annie, I shall bid you adieu
with my pen, as next week I hope to be able to
accept your often repeated invitation to come and
see myself the result of my admonitions. I shall
certainly be delighted to visit your gardens, your
poultry-yard, your dairy, and all your favourite
haunts; but what will give me most pleasure will
be to see you happy, and to be assured from your
experience that it is possible for a young and
beautiful woman, though brought up amidst all
the gaieties of a town life, to abandon them without
a sigh, and to enjoy rationally a Country
Life.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
